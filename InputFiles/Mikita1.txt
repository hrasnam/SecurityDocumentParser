Assumption
Application identifier, an ISO-7816 data format used for unique
identification of Java Card applets (and certain kinds of files in
card file systems). The Java Card platform uses the AID data
format to identify applets and packages. AIDs are administered
by the International Opens Organization (ISO), so they can be
used as unique identifiers.
AIDs are also used in the security policies (see “Context”
below): applets’ AIDs are related to the selection mechanisms,
packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the firewall.
Note: although they serve different purposes, they share the
same namespace.
Application Protocol Data Unit, an ISO 7816-4 defined
communication format between the card and the off-card
applications. Cards receive requests for service from the CAD
in the form of APDUs. These are encapsulated in Java Card
System by the javacard.framework.APDU class ( [JCAPI3]).
APDUs manage both the selection-cycle of the applets (through
Java Card RE mediation) and the communication with the
Currently selected applet.
The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent
(received) by the card depart from (arrive to). The Java Card
RE owns an APDU object (which is a Java Card RE Entry Point
and an instance if the javacard.framework.APDU class) that
encapsulates APDU messages in an internal byte array, called
the APDU buffer. This object is made accessible to the
currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent
access (out-of selection-scope) is strictly prohibited for security
reasons.
The name given to any Java Card technology-based
application. An applet is the basic piece of code that can be
selected for execution from outside the card. Each applet on
the card is uniquely identified by its AID.
Card Acceptance Device or card reader. The device where the
card is inserted, and which is used to communicate with the
card. Unless explicitly said otherwise, in this document, CAD
covers PCD.
A file in the Converted applet format. A CAP file contains a
binary representation of a package of classes that can be
installed on a device and used to execute the package’s
classes on a Java Card virtual machine. A CAP file can contain
a user library, or the code of one or more applets.
Common Criteria
In object-oriented programming languages, a class is a
prototype for an object. A class may also be considered as a
set of objects that share a common structure and behavior.
Each class declares a collection of fields and methods
associated to its instances. The contents of the fields determine
the internal state of a class instance, and the methods the
operations that can be applied to it.
Classes are ordered within a class hierarchy. A class declared
as a specialization (a subclass) of another class (its super
class) inherits all the fields and methods of the latter.
Java platform classes should not be confused with the classes

of the functional requirements (FIA) defined in the CC.
Card Manager
A context is an object-space partition associated to a package.
Applets within the same Java technology-based package
belong to the same context. The firewall is the boundary
between contexts (see “Current context”).
The Java Card RE keeps track of the current Java Card System
context (also called “the active context”). When a virtual method
is invoked on an object, and a context switch is required and
permitted, the current context is changed to correspond to the
context of the applet that owns the object. When that method
returns, the previous context is restored. Invocations of static
methods have no effect on the current context. The current
context and sharing status of an object together determine if
access to an object is permissible.
The applet has been selected for execution in the current
session. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently
selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT
command from the CAD or PCD with this applet’s AID, the Java
Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over
the I/O interface that received the command. The Java Card RE
sends all further APDU commands received over each interface
to the currently selected applet on this interface ( [JCRE3],
Glossary).
The applet that is selected after a card reset or upon
completion of the PICC activation sequence on the contactless
interface ([JCRE3], §4.1)
Differential Power Analysis is a form of side channel attack in
which an attacker studies the power consumption of a
cryptographic hardware device such as a smart card.
Evaluation Assurance Level
Pre-issuance loaded software.
Embedded Software
The mechanism in the Java Card technology for ensuring
applet isolation and object sharing. The firewall prevents an
applet in one context from unauthorized access to objects
owned by the Java Card RE or by an applet in another context.
Hardware Abstraction Layer
Integrated Circuit
The installer is the on-card application responsible for the
installation of applets on the card. It may perform (or delegate)
mandatory security checks according to the card issuer policy
(for bytecode-verification, for instance), loads and link packages
(CAP file(s)) on the card to a suitable form for the Java Card
VM to execute the code they contain. It is a subsystem of what
is usually called “card manager”; as such, it can be seen as the
portion of the card manager that belongs to the TOE.
The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may
be implemented as a Java Card applet. However, it is granted
specific privileges on an implementation-specific manner
([JCRE3],§10). The installer is the on-card application
responsible for the installation of applets on the card. It may
perform (or delegate) mandatory security checks according to

The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may
be implemented as a Java Card applet. However, it is granted
specific privileges on an implementation-specific manner
([JCRE3],§10).
A special kind of Java programming language class, which
declares methods, but provides no implementation for them. A
class may be declared as being the implementation of an
interface, and in this case must contain an implementation for
each of the methods declared by the interface (See also
shareable interface).
The runtime environment under which Java programs in a
smart card are executed. It is in charge of all the management
features such as applet lifetime, applet isolation, object sharing,
applet loading, applet initializing, transient objects, the
transaction mechanism and so on.
An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible
by any application. These methods are the gateways through
which applets request privileged Java Card RE services: the
instance methods associated to those objects may be invoked
from any context, and when that occurs, a context switch to the
Java Card RE context is performed.
There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects:
Temporary ones and Permanent ones. As part of the firewall
functionality, the Java Card RE detects and restricts attempts to
store references to these objects.
Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System
version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism enabling a client
application running on the CAD platform to invoke a method on
a remote object on the card. Notice that in Java Card System,
version 2.1.1, the only method that may be invoked from the
CAD is the process method of the applet class.
Java Card System includes the Java Card RE, the Java Card
VM, the Java Card API and the installer.
The embedded interpreter of bytecodes. The Java Card VM is
the component that enforces separation between applications
(firewall) and enables secure data sharing.
A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the
Java Card System, version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that
enables the opening of simultaneous sessions with the card,
one per logical channel. Commands issued to a specific logical
channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical
channel. Java Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic
Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical channels over
each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).
Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that
retains its contents when power is turned off.
Security objectives for the TOE.
The Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition
mechanism ensures that any unreferenced persistent
(transient) object owned by the current context is deleted. The
associated memory space is recovered for reuse prior to the
next card reset.
Security objectives for the environment.
Organizational security policies.
A package is a namespace within the Java programming
language that may contain classes and interfaces. A package
defines either a user library, or one or more applet definitions. A
package is divided in two sets of files: export files (which
exclusively contain the public interface information for an entire

Smart Card
Smart Card Platform.It is comprised of the integrated circuit, the

Security Functionality
An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet
accepts to share with other applets. These interface methods
can be invoked from an applet in a context different from the
context of the object implementing the methods, thus
“traversing” the firewall.
An object of a class implementing a shareable interface.
Security Target
An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow
among objects or change the system’s status. It usually acts on
behalf of a user. Objects can be active and thus are also
subjects of the TOE.
Target Of Evaluation
An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD
sessions. The contents of these objects are cleared at the end
of the current CAD session or when a card reset is performed.
Writes to the fields of a transient object are not affected by
transactions.
Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE. That also
covers the packages. The associated subject(s), if applicable, is
(are) an object(s) belonging to the javacard.framework.applet
class.

TOE TYPE
The Target of Evaluation detailed in this Security Target is STM Tachograph Application JTacho (from now on also referenced as the TOE).
The TOE is constituted by the following blocks:
 The Tachograph Application - (including 1st and 2nd generation application
functionalities)
 J-SAFE3 Java Card Platform (including the native Operating System, providing to
the Java Card System a low-level support of hardware functionalities and
implementing I/O communication);
 The hardware IC and its associated crypto library (already certified as ST31G480
D01 including optional crypto library NESLIB V.6.2.1) (see [STLite_ST31G480]).
The TOE is compliant with Global Platform 2.2.1 standard [GP221] which provides a set of
APIs and technologies to perform in a secure way the operations involved in the
management of the applications hosted by the card.
Being J-TACHO a closed product, card content management interface is permanently
disabled before card delivery.
After TOE delivery GP functionality is available for TOE Identification.
Besides, only the API subset related to life-cycle management of card and J-TACHO
application are considered as part of the TOE, while all other GP API and the Card Manager
application belongs to the TOE environment and are not in the scope of current evaluation.

TOE Life-Cycle
The TOE life cycle, i.e. the OS, the Java Card platform and the J-TACHO application, spans
from product development phase to its operational phase/usage by the final user. The TOE
life cycle is fully conform to the claimed PP. The TOE life cycle phases are those detailed in
. We refer to IC Protection Profile [PP_0035] and [BSI_ PP_0084] for a thorough
description of
Phases 1 to 7:

Phases 1 Embedded Software (Native OS, Java Card System, other platform
components such as Card Manager, J-TACHO Applets).

Phases 2 IC development (IC with Dedicated Software and NesLib v.6.2.1
Cryptographic Library)

Phase 3 and 4 IC manufacturing, packaging and testing. Some IC prepersonalization steps may occur in Phase 3.

Phase 5 TOE Product Finishing Process concerns with the embedding of software
components within the IC.

Phase 6 is dedicated to the TOE personalization prior final use.

Phase 7 is the TOE operational phase.
The TOE life cycle is composed of four stages:

Development,

Storage, pre-personalization and testing

Personalization

Usage.
The following entities and roles are identified:
TOE Developer: STMicroelectronics srl, Marcianise (CE) Italy
IC Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics SAS, Rousset France
TOE Personalization Agent: Public administration or National
personalization center enabled to issue personalized Tachograph card.

J-TACHO_SecurityTarget_Lite

accredited

TOE

Phase 1:
TOE development is performed during Phase 1. This includes OS, Java card system
platform (JCS) and J-Tacho application, design, implementation, testing and documentation.
The TOE development fulfils requirements of the final product, including conformance to
product specifications (e.g. Java Card, GlobalPlatform, [EU_2016_165], etc…), and
recommendations of the guidelines of IC, crypto-library and J-SAFE3. The TOE development
occurs in a controlled environment that avoids disclosure of source code, data and any
critical documentation and that guarantees the integrity of these elements.
TOE Development is performed by STMicroelectronics S.r.l in the site of M ARCIANISE
(ITALY).
Phase2, Phase 3 and Phase 4:
In Phase 3, the Security IC Manufacturer may store, pre-personalize the TOE and potentially
conduct tests on behalf of the TOE developer. This support is specifically used when the
TOE delivery shall be done by IC Manufacturer at the end of phase 5: in this case the TOE
Developer may deliver in a secure way to IC Manufacturer a NVM image of final product
configuration. On its turn, the IC Manufacturer can perform complete TOE prepersonalization on behalf of TOE Developer using the NVM image in order to obtain a fully
operational TOE. The IC Manufacturing environment shall protect the integrity and
confidentiality of the TOE and of any related material, for instance test suites.
The IC Development is performed by STMicroelectronics SAS Rousset (FRANCE).

Phase 5:
The Phase 5 composite product integration is identical to the Phase 5 Smart Card Product
Finishing Process in [PP_TACHO].
TOE Developer and/or the IC Manufacturer act as Composite Product Integrator.
The Composite Product Integrator shall initialize and pre-personalize the TOE by configuring
it according to product needs, then it shall download the J-Tacho application on top of the
JCS and finally it shall permanently disable card content management features (e.g. OS

J-TACHO_SecurityTarget_Lite

lock, disable card manager), thus making the TOE fully operational and ready for the
delivery.
The delivery of the TOE occurs at the end of Phase 5 Composite Product Integration.
Delivery and acceptance procedures shall guarantee the authenticity, the confidentiality and
integrity of the TOE.
Being the Composite Product Integrator’s environment the same as the TOE Developer/IC
Manufacturer, integrity and confidentiality of the TOE and of any related material are also
guaranteed.
The TOE Composite Product Integration is performed by STMicroelectronics S.r.l in the
site of M ARCIANISE (ITALY) and/or STMicroelectronics SAS Rousset (FRANCE).

Phase 6:
In Phase 6, the applet J-TACHO of the final product, which have been installed on the TOE
in Phase 5, can be further personalized with the creation of the application file structure
defined in [EU_2016_165] and with end user data.
The TOE can be used as a Tachograph Card (driver card, workshop card, control card or
company card) only after its personalisation, in which application data including Tachograph
Card specific cryptographic keys are stored.
The TOE Personalization agent has to follow the procedure as described in
Tacho_AGD_PRE to authenticate the role and for TOE personalization.
The TOE Personalization agent is a Public administration or National accredited TOE
personalization center enabled to issue personalized Tachograph card.

Phase 7:
The TOE final usage environment coincides with the environment of the product where the
TOE is embedded in. It covers a wide spectrum of situations that cannot be covered by
evaluations and, therefore, the TOE and the product shall provide the full set of security

Table 3: Secondary assets to be protected by the TOE and its environment

IDD and ACD are primary assets while all the others are secondary assets to be protected
by the TOE and its environment
All primary assets represent User Data in the sense of the CC. The secondary assets also
have to be protected by the TOE in order to achieve a sufficient protection of the primary
assets. The secondary assets represent TSF and TSF-data in the sense of the CC. Security
data and user data, stored by the Tachograph Card, need to be protected against
unauthorised modification and disclosure. User data include card and human user
identification data and activity data (see Glossary for more details), and match User Data in
the sense of the CC. Security data are defined as specific data needed to support security
enforcement, and match the TSF data in the sense of the CC.

7.2

Subjects and external entities
This Security Target considers the following subjects, who can interact with the TOE.
Role
Definition
Administrator/Personalization Agent
Usually active only during Personalisation
(Phase 6) – listed here for the sake of
completeness.
Vehicle Unit
Vehicle Unit (authenticated), to which the
Tachograph Card is connected (S.VU).
Other Device
Other device (not authenticated) to which the
Tachograph Card is connected (S.Non-VU).
Attacker
A human or a process located outside the
TOE and trying to undermine the security
policy defined by the current ST, especially to
change properties of the maintained assets.
For example, a driver could be an attacker if
he misuses the driver card. An attacker is
assumed to possess at most a high attack
potential.
Table 4: Subjects and external entities

Application note: This table defines the subjects in the sense of [CC1] which can be
recognised by the TOE independently of their nature (human or process). As result of an
appropriate identification and authentication process, the TOE creates – for each of the
respective external entities except the Attacker, who is listed for completeness – an ‘image’
inside and ‘works’ then with this TOE internal image (also called subject in [CC1]). From this
point of view, the TOE itself does not distinguish between “subjects” and “external entities”.
Application note: The subject Administrator/Personalization Agent is included only in few
security functional requirements related to role authentication before the TOE
Personalisation (Phase 6) is allowed this because the ST describes the TOE functionalities
only for the end-usage/operational usage (Phase 7) - after personalisation.

7.3

Threats
This section describes the threats to be countered by the TOE independently or in
collaboration with its IT environment. These threats arise from the assets protected by the
TOE and the method of TOE’s use in the operational environment.

J-TACHO_SecurityTarget_Lite

The threats are defined in the following table.
Label
T.Identification_Data

T.Application

T.Activity_Data

T.Data_Exchange

T.Clone

Threat
Modification of Identification Data - A successful modification of
identification data held by the TOE (IDD, e.g. the type of card, or the
card expiry date or the user identification data) would allow an
attacker to misrepresent driver activity.
Modification of Tachograph application - A successful modification or
replacement of the Tachograph application stored in the TOE (APP),
would allow an attacker to misrepresent human user (especially
driver) activity.
Modification of Activity Data - A successful modification of activity
data stored in the TOE (ACD) would allow an attacker to
misrepresent human user (especially driver) activity.
Modification of Activity Data during Data Transfer - A successful
modification of activity data (ACD deletion, addition or modification)
during import or export would allow an attacker to misrepresent
human user (especially driver) activity.
Cloning of cards – An attacker could read or copy secret
cryptographic keys from a Tachograph card and use it to create a
duplicate card, allowing an attacker to misrepresent human user
(especially driver) activity.

Organizational Security Policies

This section shows the organisational security policies that are to be enforced by the TOE, its operational
environment, or a combination of the two.
The organisational security policies are provided in the following table.
Label

Organisational Security Policy

P.Crypto

The cryptographic algorithms and keys described in
[EU_2016_165] Annex 1C, Appendix 11 shall be used where
data confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and/or nonrepudiation need to be protected.

7.5

Assumptions
This section describes the assumptions that are made about the operational environment in
order to be able to provide the security functionality. If the TOE is placed in an operational
environment that does not uphold these assumptions it may be unable to operate in a secure
manner.
The assumptions are provided in the following table.
Label
A.Personalisation_Phase

Assumption
Personalisation Phase Security - All data structures and data on
the card produced during the Personalisation Phase, in particular
during initialisation and/or personalisation are correct according
to [EU_2016_165] Annex 1C, and are handled correctly so as to
preserve the integrity and confidentiality of these data. This
includes in particular sufficient cryptographic quality of
cryptographic keys for the end-usage (in accordance with the
cryptographic algorithms specified for Tachograph Cards) and
their confidential handling. The Personalisation Service Provider
controls all materials, equipment and information, which is used
for initialisation and/or personalisation of authentic smart cards,
in order to prevent counterfeit of the TOE.

Security objective for the environment
Secure Handling of Data in Personalisation Phase - All data
structures and data on the card produced during the
Personalisation Phase, in particular during initialisation
and/or personalisation must be correct according to
[EU_2016_165] Annex 1C, and must be handled so as to
preserve the integrity and confidentiality of the data. The
Personalisation Service Provider must control all materials,
equipment and information that are used for initialisation
and/or personalisation of authentic smart cards, in order to
prevent counterfeit of the TOE. The execution of the TOE's
personalisation process must be appropriately secured with
the goal of data integrity and confidentiality.
Implementation of Tachograph Components – All
requirements from [EU_2016_165] concerning handling and
operation of the cryptographic algorithms and keys must be
fulfilled.
End of life - When no longer in service the TOE must be
disposed of in a secure manner, which means, as a
minimum, that the confidentiality of symmetric and private
cryptographic keys has to be safeguarded.

Security objectives rationale
The following table provides an overview for security objectives coverage (TOE and its
operational environment), also giving an evidence for sufficiency and necessity of the
security objectives defined. It shows that all threats and OSPs are addressed by the security
objectives. It also shows that all assumptions are addressed by the security objectives for
the TOE environment.

Table 10: Security Objectives Rationale

7.6.4

SPD and Security Objectives Relation
T.Identification_Data
This threat is countered by the security objective that ensures the integrity of Identification Data
(O.Card_Identification_Data) that preserves integrity of card identification data and user identification
data stored during the card personalisation process. Objectives O.Crypto_Implement and
OE.Crypto_Admin contribute to cover this threat by requiring implementation and management of
strong cryptography.
T.Application
Objective O.Software_Update covers this threat by requiring that any update to the tachograph
application is authorized. O.Crypto_Implement and O.Protect_Secret support the covering of the
threat by preserving the confidentiality of TOE’s secret cryptographic keys, preventing their copy and
misuse. OE.EOL ensures that at the end of card’s life it is properly disposed in order to prevent
misuse.
T.Activity_Data
This threat is covered by integrity of Activity Data security objectives according to which the TOE
must preserve the integrity of user data stored in the card by VU (O.Card_Activity_Storage),
O.Data_Access security objective supports the coverage by ensuring that only authenticated VU
access user data stores in the TOE. O.Crypto_Implement and OE.Crypto_Admin contribute to cover
this threat by requiring implementation and management of strong cryptography.
T.Data_Exchange
The threat is covered by O.Secure_Communications that requires usage of Secure Communications
for the TOE. Beisdes, O.Crypto_Implement and OE.Crypto_Admin give the necessary strong crypto
support to manage the communication security while O.Protect_Secret support the covering of the
threat by preserving the confidentiality of TOE’s secret cryptographic keys, preventing their copy and
misuse.
T.Clone

J-TACHO_SecurityTarget_Lite

This threat is covered by security objective O.Protect_Secret that prevent an attacker from extracting
cryptographic material from the TOE. It is also covered by OE.EOL security objective that ensures
proper disposal of the card at the end of card’s life.
P.Crypto requires usage of specific cryptographic algorithms and keys when data confidentiality,
integrity, authenticity and/or non-repudiation need to be protected, this is addressed by
corresponding security objective O.Crypto_Implement.
A.Personalization_Phase requires that all data structures and data (including cryptographic keys)
on the card produced during the Personalisation Phase, in particular during initialisation and/or
personalisation are handled correctly so as to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of these data.
This is ensured by the corresponding objectives for the environment OE.Personalization_Phase and
OE.Crypto_Admin.

Security requirements (ASE_REQ)
This section defines the detailed security requirements that shall be satisfied by the TOE. The
statement of TOE security requirements defines the functional and assurance security
requirements that the TOE needs to satisfy in order to meet the security objectives for the TOE.
The CC allows several operations to be performed on security requirements (on the component
level); refinement, selection, assignment, and iteration are defined in paragraph 8.1 of Part 1 [CC1].
Each of these operations is used in this ST.
The refinement operation is used to add detail to a requirement, and, thus, further restricts a
requirement. Refinements of security requirements are denoted in such a way that added words are
in bold text and changed words are crossed out.
The selection operation is used to select one or more options provided by the CC in stating a
requirement. Selections that have been made by the PP author are denoted by underlined text.
Selections to be filled in by the ST author appear in square brackets with an indication that a
selection is to be made, [selection:], and are italicised.
The assignment operation is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as
the length of a password. Assignments that have been made by the PP author are denoted by
underlined text. Assignments to be filled in by the ST author appear in square brackets with an
indication that an assignment is to be made [assignment:], and are italicised. In some cases the
assignment made by the PP authors defines a selection to be performed by the ST author. Thus,
this text is underlined and italicised.
Some additions have been made to the ST with respect to the PP SFRs, to incorporate in the ST the
authentication of the personalization agent. The added words are written bold, underlined and
italicised.
The iteration operation is used when a component is repeated with varying operations. Iteration is
denoted by showing a number and identifier in brackets after the component name, and the iteration
number after each element designator.
Security functional requirements for the TOE
This section is subdivided to show security functional requirements that relate to the TOE itself, and
those that relate to external communications.
Section 9.1 addresses requirements for the tachograph card.
Section 9.2 addresses the communication requirements for 2nd generation vehicle units to be used
with the TOE.
Section 9.3 addresses the communication requirements for 1st generation vehicle units to be used
with the TOE.

Note 1: The dependency FAU_GEN.1 (Audit Data Generation) is not applicable to the TOE.
Tachograph cards do not generate audit records but react with an error response. The detection of
failure events implicitly covered in FAU_SAA.1 is clarified by a related refinement of the SFR.
Note 2: The access control TSF specified in FDP_ACF.1 uses security attributes that are defined
during the Personalisation Phase, and are fixed over the whole lifetime of the TOE. No management
of these security attributes (i.e. SFR FMT_MSA.3) is necessary here, either during personalization,
or within the usage phase of the TOE. This argument holds for both FDP_ACF.1 and FDP_ITC.1.

Security requirements – internal consistency

This part of the security requirements rationale shows that the set of security requirements for the
TOE consisting of the security functional requirements (SFRs) and the security assurance
requirements (SARs) together form an internally consistent whole.

(SFRs)
The dependency analysis in section 9.6.1 for the security functional requirements shows that the
basis for internal consistency between all defined functional requirements is satisfied. All
dependencies between the chosen functional components are analysed and non-satisfied
dependencies are appropriately explained.
All subjects and objects addressed by more than one SFR in sec. 9 are also treated in a consistent
way: the SFRs impacting them do not require any contradictory property and behaviour of these
‘shared’ items. The current PP [PP_TACHO] accurately reflects the requirements of EU Parliament
and Council Regulation 165/2014, Annex I C [EU_2016_165], which is assumed to be internally
consistent.

(SARs)
The assurance package EAL4 is a pre-defined set of internally consistent assurance requirements.
The dependency analysis for the assurance components in section 9.5 shows that the assurance
requirements are internally consistent, because all (additional) dependencies are satisfied and no
inconsistency appears.
Inconsistency between functional and assurance requirements could only arise, if there are
functional-assurance dependencies being not met – an opportunity having been shown not to arise
in sections 9.6 and 9.5. Furthermore, as also discussed in section 9.5 the chosen assurance
components are adequate for the functionality of the TOE. So, there are no inconsistencies between
the goals of these two groups of security requirements.

attributes for that roles authorization are satisfied (FDP_ACC.2, FDP_ACF.1).
The TSF SF_AC security function covers the management of subject an object as defined in
(FDP_ACC.2, FDP_ACF.1). The operations allowed are defined in (FDP_ACF.1).
The TSF SF_AC satisfy the SFRs (FDP_ETC.1,FDP_ETC.2,FDP_ITC.1,FDP_ITC.2) for what
concern the import/export of user data with/without related security attributes.
