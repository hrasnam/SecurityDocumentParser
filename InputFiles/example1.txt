1.2          TOE Overview
The TOE consists of the Micro Controller and a software stack which is stored on the Micro Controller and which
can be executed by the Micro Controller. The software stack can be further split into the following components:

     • Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller, called MC FW.

     • Software for implementing cryptographic operations on the Micro Controller, called Security Software.

     • Software to update JCOP4 OS or UpdaterOS, called OS Update Component.

     • Software for implementing JCOP4 OS:

              – Software that implements low level functionality, called Native OS
              – Software that implements the Java Card Virtual Machine [35] and a Java Card Runtime Environment
                  [34], called JCVM and JCRE.
              – Software that implements the Java Card Application Programming Interface [33], called JCAPI.
              – Software for implementing content management according to GlobalPlatform [22], called GP API.
              – Software that implements a proprietary programming interface, called Extension API.
              – Software that handles personalization and configuration, called Config Applet.
              – Software to run third party native code (Secure Box Native Lib), called Secure Box.
              – Software for implementing third party functionality, called Native Applications.

1.2.1          Usage and Major Security Features of the TOE
The usage of the TOE is focused on security critical applications in small form factors. One main usage scenario
is the use in mobile phones, which can use the TOE to enable mobile payment or mobile ticketing with the phone
based on the security of the TOE.
The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller already protects against
physical attacks by applying various sensors to detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which protect
against leakage of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many cryptographic
primitives for encryption, decryption, signature generation, signature verification, key generation, secure man-
agement of PINs and secure storage of confidential data (e.g. keys, PINs). Also the software stack implements
several countermeasures to protect the TOE against attacks.
The following list contains the features of this TOE:

1.2.3          Required non-TOE Hardware/Software/Firmware
Three groups of users shall be distinguished here.

   1. The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded applets in the final
         form factor as an embedded Secure Element. These users only require a communication device to be able
         to communicate with the TOE. The TOE supports 2 communication interfaces:

           (a) SWP or DWP supporting
                      • Card Emulation Type A, Type B and Type F according to ETSI 102 622 [21].
                      • Wired Mode by using the APDUCard Gate according to ETSI 102 622 [29].
                      • Reader Mode Gate Type A and Type B according to ETSI 102 705 [28].
                      • Support for Low Power mode indication according to ETSI 102 705 [28].
           (b) SPI over ISO 7816 T=1.

   2. The second group of users are administrators of cards. They can configure the TOE by using the Config
         Applet or install additional applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.

   3. The third group of users develops Java Card applets and executes them on the TOE. These applet devel-
         opers need in addition to the communication device a set of tools for the development of applets. This set of
         tools can be obtained from the TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment,
         byte code verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

JCOP4 OS components version can be identified by using the GET PLATFORM IDENTIFIER command (see
UGM [10]). This command returns the card identification data, which includes the Hardware Type, JCOP Version,
Build Number, Mask ID, a Patch ID and Non-Volatile Memory Size. The Platform ID is a data string that allows to
identify the JCOP4 OS component. Table 1.8 in section 1.3.3 lists all possible values for the Platform ID that are
valid for this TOE.



1.3.1.3.2             OS Update Component

The OS Update Component can update JCOP4 OS and UpdaterOS and contains two main components:

     • OsSelector (no security claimed): After a hardware reset it provides the functionality to either boot Up-
         daterOS or JCOP4 OS. OsSelector also ensures that

              – only one OS is active (running) at a time.
              – at any time, at least one OS can be booted.
              – an invalid OS (e.g. partly flashed) can never be booted.

     • UpdaterOS:

              – it handles APDUs to write a new OS (either JCOP4 OS or UpdaterOS) to flash.
              – it verifies the integrity of the new OS before updating.
              – it decrypts the new OS before updating.
              – it checks if the new OS can be authenticated and checks if the update can be authorized.
              – it ensures that the activation and setting of the information that identifies the new OS is done atomically.

              – if the update fails the system stays in a secure state.

         The UpdaterOS is a standalone operating system that can only be active when JCOP4 OS is not active.
         Besides the capability to update JCOP4 OS, UpdaterOS is also capable to update itself. The UpdaterOS
         version can be queried by using a SELECT OS Update AID Command (see UGM [10]). UpdaterOS shares
         parts of the Native OS with JCOP4 OS, e.g.: communication interface, wrapper to Security Software (Flash
         Services and CryptoLib).

The JIL document [11] is used as a reference for the OS Update component implementation.


1.3.1.3.3             Native Applications

The Native Applications extend the available cryptographic algorithms for the Security Software. These Native
Applications are proprietary implementations (e.g. FeliCa, OSCCA, Korean Seed) which make use of the Security
Software’s security mechanisms. Native Applications are provided to JCOP4 OS via the Security Software. No
security functionality claimed for Native Applications, it is an extension to the Crypto Lib.

The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside the scope of this evaluation.
Applets can be loaded into Flash memory. Applet loading into Flash memory can be done in phases 3, 4, 5, and
6. Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets can be done for a
certified TOE. The certification is only valid for platforms that return the Platform Identifier as stated in Table 1.7.
The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life cycle) guarantees, that the
customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts of the TOE as outlined above. TOE documentation
is delivered in electronic form (encrypted according to defined mailing procedures).
Note: Phases 1 to 3 are under the TOE developer scope of control. Therefore, the objectives for the environment
related to phase 1 to 3 are covered by Assurance measures, which are materialized by documents, process and

procedures evaluated through the TOE evaluation process. During phases 4 to 7 the TOE is no more under the
developer control. In this environment, the TOE protects itself with its own Security functions. But some additional
usage recommendation must also be followed in order to ensure that the TOE is correctly and securely handled,
and that shall be not damaged or comprised. This ST assumes (A.USE_DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle
securely the TOE and related Objectives for the environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

Additionally to the Platform Identifier the TOE can also be identified by its sequence number:

     1. If UpdaterOS is active then the "SELECT OS Update AID" command will return the Current Sequence
         Number of UpdaterOS and the Reference Sequence Number.

     2. If JCOP4 OS is active then the "Get OS Info" command will return the Current Sequence Number of JCOP4
         OS (Final Sequence Number).

1.3.4          Evaluated Package Types
The TOE is delivered in a plastic package combined with a communication chip. All (enabled) pins of the TOE
are externally accessible. Any additional security provided by the plastic package is ignored for the security of the
TOE and therefore the package type is not security relevant. Common Criteria requirements for the acceptance
of this package type are detailed in [6].

2         Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
This chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package Claim", "PP Claim", and
"Conformance Claim Rationale".


2.1          CC Conformance Claim
This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for Information Technology Secu-
rity Evaluation according to

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1, Revision 4, Septem-
         ber 2012" [3]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1, Revision 4, Septem-
         ber 2012" [4]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1, Revision 4, Septem-
         ber 2012" [5]

The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:

     • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation Methodology, Version
         3.1, Revision 4" [7]

This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. The extended Security Func-
tional Requirements are defined in Chapter 6.


2.2          Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL6 augmented. The augmentation to
EAL6 is ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural design summary”, and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic
flaw remediation”.


2.3          PP Claim
The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card Protection Profile - Open Configuration,
Version 3.0, Certified by ANSSI, the French Certification Body May, 2012 [9]. The Java Card Protection Profile
makes the use of Java Card RMI and "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" from the group EMG op-
tional. The TOE does not support Java Card RMI and "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" from the
group EMG. This ST is more restrictive than the PP [9] which chapter 2.4 provides a rationale for.

2.4          Conformance Claim Rationale
2.4.1          TOE Type
The TOE type as stated in Section 1.2 of this ST corresponds to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 1.2
of [9] namely a Java Card platform, implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.4 [35, 34, 33].
This Security Target claims conformance to the following packages of security requirements out of those for
Cryptographic Services defined in the Smartcard IC Platform Protection profile [15].

     • Package "TDES"

     • Package "AES"

2.4.2          SPD Statement

additional threats. These threats are:

     • T.RND

     • T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

     • T.INTERRUPT-OSU

     • T.CONFIG

     • T.COM_EXPLOIT

     • T.LIFE_CYCLE

     • T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT

     • T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]

The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [15].
The threats T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE
and T.INTERRUPT-OSU are included for the OS Update which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and read access of the configu-
ration area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in the PP [9]. The threat T.ATTACK-COUNTER is
included for the Restricted Mode which is additional functionality the PP allows. The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is
included to cover communication channels attacks and it is an addition to the threats in the PP [9].
The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an addition to the threats in
the PP [9].
The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from the PP [9].
The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in the PP [9].
The threat T.SEC_BOX_BORDER is included for Secure Box which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The threat T.UDW_DEL is included for the Factory Reset which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The threat T.UDW_AUTH is included for the Factory Reset which is additional functionality the PP allows. Note
that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card RMI. The Java
Card Protection Profile [9] makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
The SPD statement presented in Chapter 4, copies the OSP from the PP [9], and adds the following additional
OSPs:

     • OSP.PROCESS-TOE

     • OSP.KEY-CHANGE

     • OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS

     • OSP.QUOTAS

     • OSP.SECURE-BOX

The OSP OSP.PROCESS-TOE is introduced for the pre-personalisation feature of the TOE and is an addition to
the OSPs in PP [9]. The OSP OSP.KEY-CHANGE is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is an addition
to the OSPs in PP [9]. The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
an addition to the OSPs in PP [9]. The OSP OSP.QUOTAS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is
an addition to the OSPs in PP [9]. The OSP.SECURE-BOX is introduced to allow execution of third party native
code and is an addition to the OSPs in PP [9].
The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [9]. The assumption A.Deletion is ex-
cluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving out the
assumption, makes the SPD of this ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [9]. As the Card Manager is part
of the TOE, it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of assuming
that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
Besides the assumptions from the PP [9], five additional assumptions are added:

The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro Controller [13], which is com-
pliant to the Security IC PP [15].
The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE
and no longer part of the environment.
The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added because Security Domains
from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the applets and packages are signed by the APSD and
the correctness is verified on the TOE by VASD before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-
PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [9] for card content management environ-
ment.

2.4.3          Security Objectives Statement

     • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS

     • OT.APPLI-AUTH

     • OT.COMM_AUTH

     • OT.COMM_INTEGRITY

     • OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY

The security objectives OT.IDENTIFICATION, OT.RND are part of the security objectives of the certified Micro
Controller [13](see also Section 1.3.1.1) and Security Software [14](see also Section 1.3.1.2.2), which are also
components of this composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the PP [9]
for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-personalisation feature of the
TOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The security objective OT.SEC_BOX_FW is related to the Secure Box, which is additional functionality the PP
allows.
The security objective OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE, OT.SECURE_LOAD_
ACODE, OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are included for the OS Update which is ad-
ditional functionality the PP allows. The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION is included for the Con-
fig Applet which is additional functionality the PP allows.   The security objectives OT.ATTACK-COUNTER and
OT.RESTRICTED-MODE are included for the restricted mode which is additional functionality the PP allows. The
security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH, OT.COMM_INTEGRITY, OT.COMM_
CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for Secure Channel,
Security Domains and Card Content Management are used from it.
The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from Security Objectives for the
Operational Environment from [9]. Additionally, some of the Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
from [9] are listed as TOE Security Objectives in this ST:

     • OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY

     • OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT

     • OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC

     • OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT

OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the TOE as the Smart Card Platform
belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card Manager
belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE, adds objectives to the
TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives is therefore equivalent to the
security objectives in the PP [9] to which conformance is claimed.

The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [9] are not included since these
functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT.
Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card RMI. The Java
Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
Note that the objective O.EXT-MEM is not included, since the TOE does not support "Management of External
Memory (EXT-MEM)". The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of "Management of External Memory
(EXT-MEM)" optional.
A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [9] has been included in this ST. The other
part of security objectives for the environment, which is present in the PP [9], is used as part of the security
objectives for the TOE in this ST. The ST also introduces eight additional security objectives for the environment.
The additional objectives for the environment are:

     • OE.USE_DIAG

     • OE.USE_KEYS

     • OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC

     • OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CREATE

     • OE.APPS-PROVIDER

     • OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY

     • OE.KEY-CHANGE

     • OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS

     • OE.QUOTAS

The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware platform (Micro Controller
[13]see also Section 1.3.1.1) that is part of this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security
objectives for the environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [15].
OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE and not a security
objective for the environment as in PP [9].
The security objective for the environment OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CREATE is to cover the confidentiality
during creation and transmission phase of D.UPDATE_IMAGE and therfore partly covers the threats introduced
by the update mechanism which is additional functionality.
OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which enable the creation, dis-
tribution and verification of secure applications. OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of the GlobalPlatform Spec-
ification.

The security objective for the environment OE.QUOTAS is to cover the limitation of allocated memory for the
security domains, packages or applets during their life-cycle and therefore covers the OSP which is additional
functionality.
The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be equivalent to the security
objectives in the PP [9] to which conformance is claimed.

2.4.4          Security Functional Requirements Statement
The Security Functional Requirements Statement copies most SFRs as defined in the PP [9], with the exception
of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs
in the PP [9]. Moreover as requested by the PP [9] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully
cover and describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
The TOE restricts remote access from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to
none, and as a result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1[JCRMI], SFRs FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI, FDP_
IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_REFS, FMT_MSA.3/JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI, FMT_
REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not included in the ST. In the PP [9] the use of the Java Card RMI is
optional. The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI.
The TOE does not allow external memory access to the services implemented by the applets on the card,
and as a result the SFRs concerning "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" (FDP_ACC.1/EXT_MEM,
FDP_ACF.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.3/EXT_MEM and FMT_SMF.1/EXT_MEM) are not
included in the ST. In the PP [9] the use of the "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" is optional. The
TOE does not implement "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)".
The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [9] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which enforces the Firewall
access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy and which is more restrictive than
the PACKAGE LOADING information flow control SFP from PP [9].
The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly replaced or refined and
are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of the newly introduced SFPs:

   1. Security Domain access control policy

   2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy

These SFPs provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING information flow
control SFP from PP [9] by following the information flow policy defined by Global Platform specifications.
The table below lists the SFRs from CarG of PP [9] and their corresponding refinements in this ST.

3         Security Aspects
This chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its environment addressed in this
ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way. In addition to this, the security aspects also give a semi-
formal framework to express the CC security environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be instantiated
as assumptions, threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security policies. The
description is based on [9].


3.1          Confidentiality
SA.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE               Confidentiality of Update Image
                                     The update image must be kept confidential. This concerns the non disclosure of
                                     the update image in transit to the card.

SA.CONFID-APPLI-DATA                 Confidentiality of Application Data
                                     Application data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This con-
                                     cerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain read access to other application’s
                                     data.

SA.CONFID-JCS-CODE                   Confidentiality of Java Card System Code
                                     Java Card System code must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. Knowl-
                                     edge of the Java Card System code may allow bypassing the TSF. This concerns
                                     logical attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to executable code, typi-
                                     cally by executing an application that tries to read the memory area where a piece
                                     of Java Card System code is stored.

SA.CONFID-JCS-DATA                   Confidentiality of Java Card System Data
                                     Java Card System data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This
                                     concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to Java Card
                                     System data. Java Card System data includes the data managed by the Java Card
                                     RE, the Java Card VM and the internal data of Java Card platform API classes as
                                     well.


3.2          Integrity
SA.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE                Integrity of Update Image
                                     The update image must be protected against unauthorized modification. This
                                     concerns the modification of the image in transit to the card.

SA.INTEG-APPLI-CODE                  Integrity of Application Code
                                     Application code must be protected against unauthorized modification. This con-
                                     cerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to the memory zone

                             also concerns the modification of application code in transit to the card.

SA.INTEG-APPLI-DATA          Integrity of Application Data
                             Application data must be protected against unauthorized modification. This con-
                             cerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain unauthorized write access to ap-
                             plication data. In post-issuance application loading, this threat also concerns the
                             modification of application data contained in a package in transit to the card. For
                             instance, a package contains the values to be used for initializing the static fields
                             of the package.

SA.INTEG-JCS-CODE            Integrity of Java Card System Code
                             Java Card System code must be protected against unauthorized modification.
                             This concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to executable
                             code.

SA.INTEG-JCS-DATA            Integrity of Java Card System Data
                             Java Card System data must be protected against unauthorized modification. This
                             concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to Java Card
                             System data. Java Card System data includes the data managed by the Java
                             Card RE, the Java Card VM and the internal data of Java Card API classes as
                             well.

                             concerns:

                               1. invoking a method outside the scope of the accessibility rules provided by
                                     the access modifiers of the Java programming language ([16])
                               2. jumping inside a method fragment or interpreting the contents of a data

                                                      memory area as if it was executable code. Note that execute access to
                                                      native code of the Java Card System and applications is the concern of
                                                      SA.NATIVE.

SA.FIREWALL                                     Firewall
                                                The Firewall shall ensure controlled sharing of class instances1 , and isolation of
                                                their data and code between packages (that is, controlled execution contexts)
                                                as well as between packages and the JCRE context. An applet shall not read,
                                                write, compare a piece of data belonging to an applet that is not in the same
                                                context, or execute one of the methods of an applet in another context without its
                                                authorization.

SA.NATIVE                                       Native Code Execution
                                                Because the execution of native code is outside of the JCS TSF scope, it must
                                                be secured so as to not provide ways to bypass the TSFs of the JCS. Loading
                                                of native code, which is as well outside those TSFs, is submitted to the same
                                                requirements. Should native software be privileged in this respect, exceptions to
                                                the policies must include a rationale for the new security framework they introduce.


3.4          Bytecode Verification
SA.VERIFICATION                                 Bytecode Verification
                                                Bytecode must be verified prior to being executed. Bytecode verification includes:

                                                   1. how well-formed CAP file is and the verification of the typing constraints on
                                                      the bytecode,
                                                   2. binary compatibility with installed CAP files and the assurance that the ex-
                                                      port files used to check the CAP file correspond to those that will be present
                                                      on the card when loading occurs.


3.5          Card Management
SA.CARD-MANAGEMENT                              Card Management


                                                   1. The card manager (CM) shall control the access to card management func-
                                                      tions such as the installation, update or deletion of applets.
                                                   2. The card manager shall implement the card issuer’s policy on the card.

                              1. The TOE must be able to return to a safe and consistent state when the
                                 installation of a package or an applet fails or be cancelled (whatever the
                                 reasons).
                              2. Installing an applet must have no effect on the code and data of already
                                 installed applets. The installation procedure should not be used to bypass
                                 the TSFs. In short, it is an atomic operation, free of harmful effects on the
                                 state of the other applets.
                              3. The procedure of loading and installing a package shall ensure its integrity
                                 and authenticity.

SA.SID                      Subject Identification


                              1. Users and subjects of the TOE must be identified.
                              2. The identity of sensitive users and subjects associated with administrative
                                 and privileged roles must be particularly protected; this concerns the Java
                                 Card RE, the applets registered on the card, and especially the default applet
                                 and the currently selected applet (and all other active applets in Java Card
                                 System). A change of identity, especially standing for an administrative role
                                 (like an applet impersonating the Java Card RE), is a severe violation of the
                                 SFR. Selection controls the access to any data exchange between the TOE
                                 and the CAD and therefore, must be protected as well. The loading of a
                                 package or any exchange of data through the APDU buffer (which can be
                                 accessed by any applet) can lead to disclosure of keys, application code or
                                 data, and so on.

SA.OBJ-DELETION             Object Deletion


                              1. Deallocation of objects should not introduce security holes in the form of
                                 references pointing to memory zones that are not longer in use, or have
                                 been reused for other purposes. Deletion of collection of objects should not
                                 be maliciously used to circumvent the TSFs.
                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that the deleted class instance
                                 is no longer accessible.

SA.DELETION                 Deletion


                              1. Deletion of installed applets (or packages) should not introduce security
                                 holes in the form of broken references to garbage collected code or data,
                                 nor should they alter integrity or confidentiality of remaining applets. The
                                 deletion procedure should not be maliciously used to bypass the TSFs.

                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that any data owned by the
                                 deleted applet is no longer accessible (shared objects shall either prevent
                                 deletion or be made inaccessible). A deleted applet cannot be selected or
                                 receive APDU commands. Package deletion shall make the code of the
                                 package no longer available for execution.
                              3. Power failure or other failures during the process shall be taken into account
                                 in the implementation so as to preserve the SFRs. This does not mandate,
                                 however, the process to be atomic. For instance, an interrupted deletion may
                                 result in the loss of user data, as long as it does not violate the SFRs.

                            The deletion procedure and its characteristics (whether deletion is either physi-
                            cal or logical, what happens if the deleted application was the default applet, the
                            order to be observed on the deletion steps) are implementation-dependent. The
                            only commitment is that deletion shall not jeopardize the TOE (or its assets) in
                            case of failure (such as power shortage).
                            Deletion of a single applet instance and deletion of a whole package are func-
                            tionally different operations and may obey different security rules. For instance,
                            specific packages can be declared to be undeletable (for instance, the Java Card
                            API packages), or the dependency between installed packages may forbid the
                            deletion (like a package using super classes or super interfaces declared in an-
                            other package).


3.6          Services
SA.ALARM                    Alarm
                            The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback upon detection of a potential security
                            violation. This particularly concerns the type errors detected by the bytecode
                            verifier, the security exceptions thrown by the Java Card VM, or any other security-
                            related event occurring during the execution of a TSF.

SA.OPERATE                  Operate


                              1. The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions.
                              2. In case of failure during its operation, the TOE must also return to a well-
                                 defined valid state before the next service request.

SA.RESOURCES                Resources
                            The TOE controls the availability of resources for the applications and enforces
                            quotas and limitations in order to prevent unauthorized denial of service or mal-

SA.CIPHER                   Cipher
                            The TOE shall provide a means to the applications for ciphering sensitive data,
                            for instance, through a programming interface to low-level, highly secure crypto-
                            graphic services. In particular, those services must support cryptographic algo-
                            rithms consistent with cryptographic usage policies and standards.

SA.KEY-MNGT                 Key Management
                            The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This
                            includes:

                              1. Keys shall be generated in accordance with specified cryptographic key gen-
                                 eration algorithms and specified cryptographic key sizes,
                              2. Keys must be distributed in accordance with specified cryptographic key dis-
                                 tribution methods,
                              3. Keys must be initialized before being used,
                              4. Keys shall be destroyed in accordance with specified cryptographic key de-
                                 struction methods.

SA.PIN-MNGT                 PIN Management
                            The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. This includes:

                              1. Atomic update of PIN value and try counter,
                              2. No rollback on the PIN-checking function,
                              3. Keeping the PIN value (once initialized) secret (for instance, no clear-PIN-
                                 reading function),
                              4. Enhanced protection of PIN’s security attributes (state, try counter ...) in
                                 confidentiality and integrity.

SA.SCP                      Smart Card Platform
                            The smart card platform must be secure with respect to the SFRs. Then:

                              1. After a power loss, RF signal loss or sudden card removal prior to completion
                                 of some communication protocol, the SCP will allow the TOE on the next
                                 power up to either complete the interrupted operation or revert to a secure
                                 state.
                              2. It does not allow the SFRs to be bypassed or altered and does not allow
                                 access to other low-level functions than those made available by the pack-
                                 ages of the Java Card API. That includes the protection of its private data
                                 and code (against disclosure or modification) from the Java Card System.
                              3. It provides secure low-level cryptographic processing to the Java Card Sys-
                                 tem.

                                 4. It supports the needs for any update to a single persistent object or class
                                    field to be atomic, and possibly a low-level transaction mechanism.
                                 5. It allows the Java Card System to store data in a ”persistent technology
                                    memory” or in volatile memory, depending on its needs (for instance, tran-
                                    sient objects must not be stored in non-volatile memory). The memory
                                    model is structured and allows for low-level control accesses (segmentation
                                    fault detection).
                                 6. It safely transmits low-level exceptions to the TOE (arithmetic exceptions,
                                    checksum errors), when applicable.
                                 7. Finally, it is required that the IC is designed in accordance with a well-defined
                                    set of policies and standards (for instance, those specified in [15]), and will
                                    be tamper resistant to actually prevent an attacker from extracting or altering
                                    security data (like cryptographic keys) by using commonly employed tech-
                                    niques (physical probing and sophisticated analysis of the chip). This espe-
                                    cially matters to the management (storage and operation) of cryptographic
                                    keys.

SA.TRANSACTION                 Transaction
                               The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. This
                               mechanism must not jeopardise the execution of the user applications. The trans-
                               action status at the beginning of an applet session must be closed (no pending
                               updates).

SA.CONFIG-APPLET               Config Applet
                               The Config Applet is a JCOP functionality which allows to:

                                 1. Read and modify configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE,
                                 2. Disable Access to configuration item.


3.8          OS Update
SA.OSU                         OS Update
                               The UpdaterOS allows to update JCOP4 OS and the UpdaterOS itself. It ensures
                               that only valid updates can be installed on the TOE.


3.9          Restricted Mode
SA.RM                          Restricted Mode

4         Security Problem Definition (ASE_SPD)
4.1          Assets
Assets are security-relevant elements to be directly protected by the TOE. Confidentiality of assets is always
intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various parties are involved during the first stages of
the smart card product life-cycle. Details concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 hereafter.
Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of integrity or both integrity and
confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the threats that the TOE is exposed to.
The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to whether it is data created
by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken
from Section 5.1 of [9].

                                      of the currently executed method, or a position of the operand
                                      stack. To be protected from unauthorized disclosure.
                      D.APP_I_DATA    Integrity sensitive data of the applications, like the data contained
                                      in an object, a static field of a package, a local variable of the
                                      currently executed method, or a position of the operand stack. To
                                      be protected from unauthorized modification.
                      D.APP_KEYS      Cryptographic keys owned by the applets. To be protected from
                                      unauthorized disclosure and modification.

                                An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated
                                by the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers pro-
                                vided. An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers
                                which might be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate
                                cryptographic keys. Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statis-
                                tical properties of the random numbers generated by the TOE without specific
                                knowledge about the TOE’s generator. Malfunctions or premature ageing are also
                                considered which may assist in getting information about random numbers.

4.3          Organisational Security Policies
OSP.VERIFICATION                  File Verification
                                  This policy shall ensure the consistency between the export files used in the veri-
                                  fication and those used for installing the verified file. The policy must also ensure
                                  that no modification of the file is performed in between its verification and the
                                  signing by the verification authority. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                                  If the application development guidance provided by the platform developer con-
                                  tains recommandations related to the isolation property of the platform, this policy
                                  shall also ensure that the verification authority checks that these recommanda-
                                  tions are applied in the application code

OSP.PROCESS-TOE                   Identification of the TOE
                                  An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                                  instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

OSP.KEY-CHANGE                    Security Domain Keys Change
                                  The AP shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before any operation
                                  on its Security Domain.

OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS              Security Domains
                                  Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage

OSP.QUOTAS                          Quotas for Security Domains, packages and applets
                                    Security domains, packages and applets may be subject to memory quotas during
                                    their life-cycle.

OSP.SECURE-BOX                      Secure Box Border
                                    Execution of untrusted native code shall be possible without any harm, manipula-
                                    tion, or influence on other parts of the TOE.


4.4          Assumptions
Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the
assumption is no longer relevant.
A.APPLET                            Applets without Native Methods
                                    Applets loaded post-issuance do not contain native methods. The Java Card spec-
                                    ification explicitly ”does not include support for native methods” ([35]) outside the
                                    API.

A.VERIFICATION                      Bytecode Verification
                                    All the bytecodes are verified at least once, before the loading, before the installa-
                                    tion or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure
                                    that each bytecode is valid at execution time.

A.USE_DIAG                          Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                                    It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure com-
                                    munication protocols offered by the TOE.

A.USE_KEYS                          Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                                    It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used
                                    for secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals
                                    are protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                                    This is especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                                    Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                                    protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclo-
                                    sure of such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE
                                    control, may compromise the security of the TOE.

A.PROCESS-SEC-IC                    Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalisation
                                    It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the
                                    TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality
                                    and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any
                                    possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means
                                    that the Phases after TOE Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.

A.APPS-PROVIDER             Application Provider
                            The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is respon-
                            sible for his security domain keys (D.APSD_KEYS).
                            Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it
                            can be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport
                            operator for a transport application.

A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY    Verification Authority
                            The VA is a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded on
                            the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application
                            and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.
                            Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation
                            upon loading.

5         Security Objectives
5.1          Security Objectives for the TOE
5.1.1          Identification
OT.SID                          Subject Identification
                                The TOE shall uniquely identify every subject (applet, or package) before granting it
                                access to any service.


5.1.2          Execution
OT.FIREWALL                     Firewall
                                The TOE shall ensure controlled sharing of data containers owned by applets of dif-
                                ferent packages or the JCRE and between applets and the TSFs. See SA.FIREWALL
                                for details.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID         Confidentiality of Global Arrays
                                The TOE shall ensure that the APDU buffer that is shared by all applications is always
                                cleaned upon applet selection. The TOE shall ensure that the global byte array used
                                for the invocation of the install method of the selected applet is always cleaned after
                                the return from the install method.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_INTEG          Integrity of Global Arrays
                                The TOE shall ensure that only the currently selected applications may have a write
                                access to the APDU buffer and the global byte array used for the invocation of the
                                install method of the selected applet.

OT.NATIVE                       Native Code
                                The only means that the Java Card VM shall provide for an application to execute
                                native code is the invocation of a method of the Java Card API, or any additional API.
                                See SA.NATIVE for details.

OT.OPERATE                      Correct Operation
                                The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions. See
                                SA.OPERATE for details.

OT.REALLOCATION                 Secure Re-Allocation
                                The TOE shall ensure that the re-allocation of a memory block for the runtime areas
                                of the Java Card VM does not disclose any information that was previously stored in
                                that block.

OT.RESOURCES                    Resources availability
                                The TOE shall control the availability of resources for the applications. See SA.RESOURCES

5.1.3          Services
OT.ALARM                         Alarm
                                 The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback information upon detection of a potential
                                 security violation. See SA.ALARM for details.

OT.CIPHER                        Cipher
                                 The TOE shall provide a means to cipher sensitive data for applications in a secure
                                 way. In particular, the TOE must support cryptographic algorithms consistent with
                                 cryptographic usage policies and standards. See SA.CIPHER for details.

OT.KEY-MNGT                      Key Management
                                 The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This con-
                                 cerns the correct generation, distribution, access and destruction of cryptographic
                                 keys. See SA.KEY-MNGT.

OT.PIN-MNGT                      Pin Management
                                 The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. See SA.PIN-MNGT
                                 for details.
                                 AppNote: PIN objects may play key roles in the security architecture of client applica-
                                 tions. The way they are stored and managed in the memory of the smart card must
                                 be carefully considered, and this applies to the whole object rather than the sole value
                                 of the PIN.

OT.TRANSACTION                   Transaction
                                 The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. See
                                 SA.TRANSACTION for details.


5.1.4          Object Deletion
OT.OBJ-DELETION                  Object Deletion
                                 The TOE shall ensure the object deletion shall not break references to objects. See
                                 SA.OBJ-DELETION for further details.


5.1.5          Applet Management
OT.APPLI-AUTH                    Application Authentication
                                 The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the
                                 card issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the
                                 card. This security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from
                                 [9].
                                 AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                                 will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications
                                 are enforced. For example this authority (DAP) or a third party (Mandated DAP) can

                                 application loading.

OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS                 Domain Rights
                                 The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain
                                 keys which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to
                                 the AP who owns the security domain.
                                 AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel be-
                                 tween them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer. The
                                 security domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-
                                 CHANGE).

OT.COMM_AUTH                     Communication Mutual Authentication
                                 The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                                 receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

OT.COMM_INTEGRITY                Communication Request Integrity
                                 The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                                 receives.

OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY          Communication Request Confidentiality
                                 The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted
                                 data.


5.1.6          Card Management
OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT               Card Management
                                 The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradi-
                                 tion, deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the
                                 whole device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application
                                 with specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control
                                 the access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s
                                 policy on card management.
                                 The Security Objective from [9] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                                 listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                                 Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refine-
                                 ment for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [9].
                                 Thus, the following objectives are also covered:

                                    • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected
                                         (See SA.INSTALL for details).
                                    • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                                    • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.

                                AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of
                                the TOE, which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective
                                enforcement of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure au-
                                thentication of the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers
                                owning a Security Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel.
                                This channel will be used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE
                                in confidentiality and integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Ser-
                                vice Providers owning a Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated
                                Management) can manage the applications on the card associated with its Security
                                Domain. This is done accordingly with the card issuer’s policy on card management.
                                The actor performing the operation must beforehand authenticate with the Security
                                Domain. In the case of Delegated Management, the card management command will
                                be associated with an electronic signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD
                                before execution.
                                The Security Objective from [9] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                                listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                                Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refine-
                                ment for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [9].
                                Thus, the following AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:

                                     • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the
                                       card may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking
                                       the CAD and the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment,
                                       the attacker may try to capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent
                                       to the card. He may also try to send one of its own applications as if it came
                                       from the card issuer. Thus, this objective is intended to ensure the integrity and
                                       authenticity of loaded CAP files.

OT.IDENTIFICATION               TOE identification
                                The TOE must provide means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data
                                in its non-volatile memory. The Initialization Data (or parts of them) are used for TOE

                                instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy.
                                The TOE will ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is avail-
                                able to an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic
                                keys.

The following Security Objectives have been added to comply to JIL "Security requirements for post-delivery code
loading" [11].
OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE                Secure loading of the Additional Code
                                    The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of
                                    the loaded Additional Code. The Loader enforces that only the allowed version of the
                                    Additional Code can be loaded on the Initial TOE. The Loader shall forbid the loading
                                    of an Additional Code not intended to be assembled with the Initial TOE. During the
                                    Load Phase of an Additional Code, the TOE shall remain secure.

OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION             Secure activation of the Additional Code
                                    Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be per-
                                    formed at the same time in an Atomic way. All the operations needed for the code
                                    to be able to operate as in the Final TOE shall be completed before activation. If the
                                    Atomic Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise
                                    (in case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the
                                    Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION               Secure identification of the TOE
                                    The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE pro-
                                    vides means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees
                                    the integrity of these data. After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identifi-
                                    cation Data of the Final TOE allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code.
                                    The user shall be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) which
                                    are embedded in the Final TOE.


5.1.11            Config Applet
OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION               Card Configuration
                                    The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration
                                    items and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items. Addition-
                                    ally, the customer can only disable the customer configuration and NXP can disable
                                    customer and NXP configuration.


5.1.12            Restricted Mode
OT.ATTACK-COUNTER                   Attack Counter
                                    The TOE shall ensure that only the ISD can reset the Attack Counter.

OT.RESTRICTED-MODE                  Restricted Mode
                                    The TOE shall ensure that in Restricted Mode all operations return an error except for
                                    the limited set of commands that are allowed by the TOE when in Restricted Mode.

5.1.13            Factory Reset
OT.UDW_AUTH                       Triggering
                                  The TOE shall ensure that only authorized users can trigger the Factory Reset pro-
                                  cess.

OT.UDW_CLEAR                      Clear List
                                  The TOE shall ensure that only authorized applications can modify the Clear List and
                                  that only contents included in the Clear List are deleted during the Factory reset:
                                  applets, packages, SDs and their related data.

OT.UDW_ATOMIC                     Atomicity
                                  The TOE shall ensure that in the case that the Factory Reset process gets interrupted
                                  (e.g. tearing event) it must be resumed and concluded before processing further
                                  commands.


5.2          Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
OE.APPLET                         Applet
                                  No applet loaded post-issuance shall contain native methods.

OE.VERIFICATION                   Bytecode Verification
                                  All the bytecodes shall be verified at least once, before the loading, before the instal-
                                  lation or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure
                                  that each bytecode is valid at execution time. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                                  Additionally, the applet shall follow all the recommendations, if any, mandated in the
                                  platform guidance for maintaining the isolation property of the platform.
                                  Application Note:
                                  Constraints to maintain the isolation property of the platform are provided by the plat-
                                  form developer in application development guidance. The constraints apply to all
                                  application code loaded in the platform.

OE.CODE-EVIDENCE                  Code Evidence
                                  For application code loaded pre-issuance, evaluated technical measures implemented
                                  by the TOE or audited organizational measures must ensure that loaded application
                                  has not been changed since the code verifications required in OE.VERIFICATION.
                                  For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card according to the re-
                                  quirements of OE.VERIFICATION, the verification authority shall provide digital ev-
                                  idence to the TOE that the application code has not been modified after the code
                                  verification and that he is the actor who performed code verification.
                                  For application code loaded post-issuance and partially or entirely verified on-card,
                                  technical measures must ensure that the verification required in OE.VERIFICATION
                                  are performed. On-card bytecode verifier is out of the scope of this Protection Profile.

                            Application Note: For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card,
                            the integrity and authenticity evidence can be achieved by electronic signature of the
                            application code, after code verification, by the actor who performed verification.

OE.APPS-PROVIDER            Application Provider
                            The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for
                            its security domain keys.

OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY   Verification Authority
                            The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application
                            loaded on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an ap-
                            plication and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the
                            TOE.

OE.KEY-CHANGE               Security Domain Key Change
                            The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS         Security Domains
                            Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage
                            phase in post-issuance mode.

OE.QUOTAS                   Quotas for Security Domains, packages and Applets
                            Security Domains, packages and applets may be subject to memory quotas during
                            their life cycle.

OE.USE_DIAG                 Secure TOE communication protocols
                            Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environ-
                            ment.

OE.USE_KEYS                 Protection of OPE keys
                            During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE, shall ensure
                            the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means
                            and/or procedures.

OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC           Protection during composite product manufacturing
                            Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-
                            consumer to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing
                            and test data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unautho-
                            rised use). This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must
                            be protected appropriately.

OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CR   Confidentiality of Update Image - CREATE
EATE
                            The off-card Update Image Creator ensures that the image is signed and transferred
                            encrypted to the device and is not disclosed during the creation and transfer. The
                            keys used for signing and encrypting the image are kept confidential.

5.3          Security Objectives Rationale
In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Chapter 4 can be traced for all aspects identified
in the TOE-security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security objective results
from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one OSP or assumption exists for each security
objective.

                 OE.VERIFICATION          Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode. Byte-
                                          code verification ensures that each of the instructions used on
                                          the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and in
                                          the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instruc-
                                          tions enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can

5.3.1.3 Identity Usurpation
T.SID.1

                 Objective                 Rationale
                 OT.SID                    Counters this threat by providing unique subject identification.
                 OT.FIREWALL               Counters the threat by providing separation of application data
                                           (like PINs).
                 OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID   Counters this threat by preventing the disclosure of the installa-
                                           tion parameters of an applet (like its name). These parameters
                                           are loaded into a global array that is also shared by all the ap-
                                           plications. The disclosure of those parameters could be used to
                                           impersonate the applet.
                 OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_INTEG    Counters this threat by preventing the disclosure of the installa-

5.3.1.4 Unauthorized Excecution
T.EXE-CODE.1

                 Objective            Rationale
                 OT.FIREWALL          Counters the threat by preventing the execution of non-shareable
                                      methods of a class instance by any subject apart from the class
                                      instance owner.
                 OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecodes.
                                      Bytecode verification ensures that each of the instructions used
                                      on the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and
                                      in the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instruc-
                                      tions enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can

                                      Bytecode verification ensures that each of the instructions used
                                      on the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and
                                      in the intended scope of accessibility. Especially the control flow
                                      confinement and the validity of the method references used in the
                                      bytecodes are guaranteed.


T.NATIVE

                 Objective            Rationale
                 OT.NATIVE            Counters this threat by ensuring that a Java Card applet can only

                                      management functions such as the loading, installation, extradi-
                                      tion or deletion of applets.
                 OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS     Contributes to counter this threat by restricting the modification
                                      of an AP security domain keyset to the AP who owns it.
                 OT.COMM_AUTH         Contributes to counter this threat by preventing unauthorized
                                      users from initiating a malicious card management operation.
                 OT.COMM_INTEGRITY    Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the integrity of the
                                      card management data while it is in transit to the TOE.

                 Objective                 Rationale
                 OT.OBJ-DELETION           Counters this threat by ensuring that object deletion shall not
                                           break references to objects.


5.3.1.8 Miscellaneous
T.PHYSICAL

                 Objective                 Rationale
                 OT.SCP.IC                 Counters phyiscal attacks. Physical protections rely on the un-
                                           derlying platform and are therefore an environmental issue.
                 OT.RESTRICTED-MODE        Contributes to counter the threat by ensuring that if the limit of the
                                           Attack Counter is reached only limited functionality is available.

                 Objective                   Rationale
                 OT.RND                      Counters the threat by ensuring the cryptographic quality of ran-
                                             dom number generation. For instance random numbers shall not
                                             be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. Furthermore,
                                             the TOE ensures that no information about the produced random
                                             numbers is available to an attacker.


5.3.1.10 Config Applet
T.CONFIG

                 Objective                   Rationale
                 OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION       Counters the threat by ensuring that the customer can only read
                                             and write customer configuration items using the Customer Con-
                                             figuration Token and NXP can read and write configuration items
                                             using the NXP Configuration Token. If access is disabled config-
                                             uration items can not be read or written.


5.3.1.11 Secure Box
T.SEC_BOX_BORDER

                 Objective                   Rationale
                 OT.SEC_BOX_FW               Counters the threat by ensuring that the native code separated
                                             in the Secure Box and the data belonging to this native code is
                                             completely sealed off from the Java Card System. Due to the
                                             separation the native code in the Secure Box cannot harm the
                                             code and data outside the Secure Box


5.3.1.12 OS Update
T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

                 Objective                 Rationale
                 OT.UDW_ATOMIC             Counters the threat by ensuring that the Factory Reset process
                                           is finished when first APDU is received after TOE startup.
                 OT.UDW_CLEAR              Counter the threat by deleting all applets, packages, SDs and
                                           their associated data that are part of the Clear List.


T.UDW_AUTH

                                           start the Factory Reset process.


5.3.2          Organisational Security Policies
OSP.VERIFICATION

                 Objective                 Rationale
                 OE.VERIFICATION           Enforces the OSP by guaranteeing that all the bytecodes shall be
                                           verified at least once, before the loading, before the installation
                                           or before the execution in order to ensure that each bytecode is
                                           valid at execution time.
                 OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT        Contributing to enforce the OSP by ensuring that the loading of a

                Objective             Rationale
                OE.CODE-EVIDENCE      This policy is enforced by the security objective of the environ-
                                      ment OE.CODE-EVIDENCE which ensures that evidences exist
                                      that the application code has been verified and not changed after
                                      verification.
                OT.APPLI-AUTH         Contributing to enforce the OSP by ensuring that the loading of a

OSP.PROCESS-TOE

                Objective             Rationale
                OT.IDENTIFICATION     Enforces this organisational security policy by ensuring that the
                                      TOE can be uniquely identified.


OSP.KEY-CHANGE

                Objective             Rationale
                OE.KEY-CHANGE         Enforces the OSP by ensuring that the initial keys of the secu-
                                      rity domain are changed before any operation on them are per-
                                      formed.


OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS

                Objective             Rationale
                OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS   Enforces the OSP by dynamically create, delete, and block the
                                      security domain during usage phase in post-issuance mode.


OSP.QUOTAS

                Objective             Rationale
                OE.QUOTAS             Enforces the OSP by applying memory quotas to security do-
                                      mains, packages and applets during their life-cycle


OSP.SECURE-BOX

                Objective             Rationale
                OT.SEC_BOX_FW         Addresses directly this organizational security policy by ensuring
                                      that the native code and data in Secure Box is separated from
                                      the rest of the TOE. Due to this separation the native code in the
                                      Secure Box cannot harm the code and data outside the Secure
                                      Box.

5.3.3          Assumptions
A.APPLET

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.APPLET           Upholds the assumption by ensuring that no applet loaded post-
                                     issuance shall contain native methods.


A.VERIFICATION

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.VERIFICATION     Upholds the assumption by guaranteeing that all the bytecodes
                                     shall be verified at least once, before the loading, before the in-
                                     stallation or before the execution in order to ensure that each
                                     bytecode is valid at execution time.
                 OE.CODE-EVIDENCE    This assumption is also upheld by the security objective of the en-
                                     vironment OE.CODE-EVIDENCE which ensures that evidences
                                     exist that the application code has been verified and not changed
                                     after verification.


A.USE_DIAG

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.USE_DIAG         Directly upholds this assumption.


A.USE_KEYS

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.USE_KEYS         Directly upholds this assumption.


A.PROCESS-SEC-IC

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC   Directly upholds this assumption.


A.APPS-PROVIDER

                 Objective           Rationale
                 OE.APPS-PROVIDER    Directly upholds this assumption.

6         Extended Components Definition (ASE_ECD)
6.1          Definition of Family ”Generation of random numbers (FCS_RNG)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0084-2014) Smartcard IC Platform Protection Profile
[15].

6.1.1          Family behavior
This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are intended to be use for
cryptographic purposes.
Component leveling:




                                          Fig. 6.1: Random Number Generation


FCS_RNG                  Generation of random numbers requires that random numbers meet a defined quality metric.

Management:              FCS_RNG.1
                         There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:                   FCS_RNG.1
                         There are no actions defined to be auditable.
FCS_RNG.1                Random Number Generation.

Hierarchical to:         No other components.

Dependencies             No dependencies.

FCS_RNG.1.1              The TSF shall provide a [selection: physical, non-physical true, deterministic, hybrid physical,
                         hybrid deterministic] random number generator that implements: [assignment: list of security
                         capabilities].

FCS_RNG.1.2              The TSF shall provide [selection: bits, octets of bits, numbers [assignment: format of the num-
                         bers]] that meet [assignment: a defined quality metric].

                         Application Note: A physical random number generator (RNG) produces the random number by
                         a noise source based on physical random processes. A non-physical true RNG uses a noise
                         source based on non-physical random processes like human interaction (key strokes, mouse
                         movement). A deterministic RNG uses an random seed to produce a pseudorandom output. A
                         hybrid RNG combines the principles of physical and deterministic RNGs where a hybrid physical
                         RNG produces at least the amount of entropy the RNG output may contain and the internal state
                         of a hybrid deterministic RNG output contains fresh entropy but less than the output of RNG may
                         contain.

6.2          Definition of Family ”Audit Data Storage (FAU_SAS)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0084-2014) Smartcard IC Platform Protection Profile
[15]. To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (”Audit Data Storage (FAU_
SAS)”) of the Class ”Security audit (FAU)” is defined here. This family describes the functional requirements for
the storage of audit data. It has a more general approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require
the data to be generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
records.

6.2.1          Family behavior
This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.
Component leveling:




                                                Fig. 6.2: SAS Component


FAU_SAS                  Requires the TOE to provide the possibility to store audit data.

Management:              FAU_SAS.1
                         There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:                   FAU_SAS.1
                         There are no actions defined to be auditable.
FAU_SAS.1                Audit storage.

Hierarchical to:         No other components.

Dependencies             No dependencies.

FAU_SAS.1.1              The TSF shall provide [assignment: list of subjects] with the capability to store [assignment: list
                         of audit information] in the [assignment: type of persistent memory].

7         Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)
This section states the security functional requirements for the TOE. For readability requirements are arranged
into groups taken from [9]. The permitted operations (assignment, iteration, selection and refinement) of the
SFRs taken from Common Criteria [4] are printed in bold. Completed operations related to the PP are additionally
marked within [ ] where assignments are additionally marked with the keyword "assignment".

                      Group                        Description
                      Core with Logical Channels   The CoreG_LC contains the requirements concerning the run-
                      (CoreG_LC)                   time environment of the Java Card System implementing logi-
                                                   cal channels. This includes the firewall policy and the require-
                                                   ments related to the Java Card API. Logical channels are a Java
                                                   Card specification version 2.2 feature. This group is the union
                                                   of requirements from the Core (CoreG) and the logical channels
                                                   (LCG) groups defined in [18] (cf. Java Card System Protection
                                                   Profile Collection [19]).
                      Installation (InstG)         The InstG contains the security requirements concerning the in-
                                                   stallation of post-issuance applications. It does not address card
                                                   management issues in the broad sense, but only those security
                                                   aspects of the installation procedure that are related to applet
                                                   execution.
                      Applet deletion (ADELG)      The ADELG contains the security requirements for erasing in-
                                                   stalled applets from the card, a feature introduced in Java Card
                                                   specification version 2.2.
                      Remote Method Invocation     The RMIG contains the security requirements for the remote
                      (RMIG)                       method invocation feature, which provides a new protocol of com-
                                                   munication between the terminal and the applets. This was intro-
                                                   duced in Java Card specification version 2.2.
                      Object deletion (ODELG)      The ODELG contains the security requirements for the object
                                                   deletion capability.   This provides a safe memory recovering
                                                   mechanism. This is a Java Card specification version 2.2 fea-
                                                   ture.
                      Secure carrier (CarG)        The CarG group contains minimal requirements for secure down-
                                                   loading of applications on the card. This group contains the se-
                                                   curity requirements for preventing, in those configurations that do
                                                   not support on-card static or dynamic bytecode verification, the
                                                   installation of a package that has not been bytecode verified, or
                                                   that has been modified after bytecode verification.
                      External Memory (EMG)        The EMG group contains security requirements for the manage-
                                                   ment of external memory.

Subjects are active components of the TOE that (essentially) act on the behalf of users. The users of the TOE
include people or institutions (like the applet developer, the card issuer, the verification authority), hardware (like
the CAD where the card is inserted or the PCD) and software components (like the application packages installed
on the card). Some of the users may just be aliases for other users. For instance, the verification authority in
charge of the bytecode verification of the applications may be just an alias for the card issuer. Subjects (prefixed
with an "S") are described in the following table:

                      Subject              Description
                      S.ADEL               The applet deletion manager which also acts on behalf of the
                                           card issuer. It may be an applet ([34], §11), but its role asks
                                           anyway for a specific treatment from the security viewpoint. This
                                           subject is unique and is involved in the ADEL security policy.
                      S.APPLET             Any applet instance.
                      S.Application        Applet loaded pre-issuance onto TOE that triggeres the Factory
                                           Reset process and modifies the Clear List.
                      S.CAD                The CAD represents the actor that requests services by issuing
                                           commands to the card. It also plays the role of the off-card entity
                                           that communicates with the S.INSTALLER.
                      S.FAR                Applet loaded pre-issuance onto TOE that triggeres the Factory
                                           Reset process and modifies the Clear List.
                      S.INSTALLER          The installer is the on-card entity which acts on behalf of the card
                                           issuer. This subject is involved in the loading of packages and

AppNote                            It should be noticed that accessing array’s components of a static array, and more gener-
                                   ally fields and methods of static objects, is an access to the corresponding O.JAVAOBJECT.

                                  Java Card RE may be in charge of this aspect. This can be done, for instance, by
                                  ensuring that references to objects belonging to a deleted application are consid-
                                  ered as a null reference.

                            In the case of an array type, fields are components of the array ([17], §2.14, §2.7.7), as
                            well as the length; the only methods of an array object are those inherited from the Object
                            class.
                            The Sharing attribute defines four categories of objects:

                                • Standard ones, whose both fields and methods are under the firewall policy,
                                • Shareable interface Objects (SIO), which provide a secure mechanism for inter-
                                  applet communication,
                                • JCRE entry points (Temporary or Permanent), who have freely accessible methods
                                  but protected fields,
                                • Global arrays, having both unprotected fields (including components; refer to JavaC-
                                  ardClass discussion above) and methods.

                            When a new object is created, it is associated with the Currently Active Context. But the
                            object is owned by the applet instance within the Currently Active Context when the object
                            is instantiated ([34], §6.1.3). An object is owned by an applet instance, by the JCRE or
                            by the package library where it has been defined (these latter objects can only be arrays
                            that initialize static fields of packages).
                            ([34], Glossary) Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently
                            selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command with this applet’s AID,
                            the Java Card RE makes this applet the Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE
                            sends all APDU commands to the Selected Applet Context.
                            While the expression ”Selected Applet Context” refers to a specific installed applet, the
                            relevant aspect to the policy is the context (package AID) of the selected applet. In this
                            policy, the ”Selected Applet Context” is the AID of the selected package.
                            ([34], §6.1.2.1) At any point in time, there is only one active context within the Java Card
                            VM (this is called the Currently Active Context).
                            It should be noticed that the invocation of static methods (or access to a static field) is
                            not considered by this policy, as there are no firewall rules. They have no effect on the
                            active context as well and the ”acting package” is not the one to which the static method
                            belongs to in this case.
                            It should be noticed that the Java Card platform, version 2.2.x and version 3 Classic
                            Edition, introduces the possibility for an applet instance to be selected on multiple logical
                            channels at the same time, or accepting other applets belonging to the same package
                            being selected simultaneously. These applets are referred to as multiselectable applets.
                            Applets that belong to a same package are either all multiselectable or not ([35], §2.2.5).
                            Therefore, the selection mode can be regarded as an attribute of packages. No selection
                            mode is defined for a library package.
                            An applet instance will be considered an active applet instance if it is currently selected in
                            at least one logical channel. An applet instance is the currently selected applet instance
                            only if it is processing the current command. There can only be one currently selected
                            applet instance at a given time. ([34], §4).

                            It should be noticed that this policy essentially applies to the execution of bytecode. Na-
                            tive methods, the Java Card RE itself and possibly some API methods can be granted

                            ments. The way the Java Card virtual machine manages the transfer of values on the
                            stack and local variables (returned values, uncaught exceptions) from and to internal reg-
                            isters is implementation dependent. For instance, a returned reference, depending on
                            the implementation of the stack frame, may transit through an internal register prior to
                            being pushed on the stack of the invoker. The returned bytecode would cause more than
                            one OP.PUT operation under this scheme.

                                such evolution will naturally change the range of ”secure values” for this component.

7.1.1.2         Application Programming Interface
The following SFRs are related to the Java Card API. The whole set of cryptographic algorithms is generally not
implemented because of limited memory resources and/or limitations due to exportation. Therefore, the following
requirements only apply to the implemented subset. It should be noticed that the execution of the additional native
code is not within the TSF. Nevertheless, access to API native methods from the Java Card System is controlled
by TSF because there is no difference between native and interpreted methods in their interface or invocation
mechanism.

AppNote                     The allocation of a resource to the APDU buffer is typically performed as the result of a

AppNote                     A resource is allocated to the bArray object when a call to an applet’s install() method is
                            performed. There is no conflict with FDP_ROL.1 here because of the bounds on the roll-
                            back mechanism (FDP_ROL.1.2[FIREWALL]): the scope of the rollback does not extend
                            outside the execution of the install() method, and the de-allocation occurs precisely right
                            after the return of it.

AppNote                          Transactions are a service offered by the APIs to applets. It is also used by some APIs
                                 to guarantee the atomicity of some operation. This mechanism is either implemented
                                 in Java Card platform or relies on the transaction mechanism offered by the underlying
                                 platform. Some operations of the API are not conditionally updated, as documented in
                                 [33] (see for instance, PIN-blocking, PIN-checking, update of Transient objects).

FDP_SDI.2.1                 The TSF shall monitor user data stored in containers controlled by the TSF for [assign-
                            ment: integrity errors] on all objects, based on the following attributes: [assignment:
                            integrity protected data].
FDP_SDI.2.2                 Upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall [assignment: reset the card
                            session for integrity errors ].

Refinement                  The following data elements have the user data attribute ”integrity protected data”:

                               • D.APP_KEYs
                               • D.PIN
                               • D.TOE_IDENTIFIER

AppNote                        • Although no such requirement is mandatory in the Java Card specification, at least
                                 an exception shall be raised upon integrity errors detection on cryptographic keys,
                                 PIN values and their associated security attributes. Even if all the objects cannot be
                                 monitored, cryptographic keys and PIN objects shall be considered with particular
                                 attention by ST authors as they play a key role in the overall security.
                               • It is also recommended to monitor integrity errors in the code of the native applica-
                                 tions and Java Card applets.
                               • For integrity sensitive application, their data shall be monitored (D.APP_I_DATA):
                                 applications may need to protect information against unexpected modifications, and
                                 explicitly control whether a piece of information has been changed between two
                                 accesses. For example, maintaining the integrity of an electronic purse’s balance
                                 is extremely important because this value represents real money. Its modification
                                 must be controlled, for illegal ones would denote an important failure of the payment
                                 system.

                            card world. The precise list of operations and objects is left unspecified, but should at
                            least concern secret keys and PIN codes when they exists on the card, as well as the

                               • This element is not within the scope of the Java Card specification, which only man-
                                 dates the behavior of the Java Card System in good working order. Further details
                                 on the ”maintenance mode” shall be provided in specific implementations. The fol-
                                 lowing is an excerpt from [4], p298: In this maintenance mode normal operation
                                 might be impossible or severely restricted, as otherwise insecure situations might
                                 occur. Typically, only authorised users should be allowed access to this mode but
                                 the real details of who can access this mode is a function of FMT: Security manage-
                                 ment. If FMT: Security management does not put any controls on who can access
                                 this mode, then it may be acceptable to allow any user to restore the system if the
                                 TOE enters such a state. However, in practice, this is probably not desirable as the
                                 user restoring the system has an opportunity to configure the TOE in such a way as
                                 to violate the SFRs.

                               • Should the installer fail during loading/installation of a package/applet, it has to
                                 revert to a ”consistent and secure state”. The Java Card RE has some clean up
                                 duties as well; see [34], §11.1.5 for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is left to
                                 implementers. This component shall include among the listed failures the deletion
                                 of a package/applet. See ([34], §11.3.4) for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is
                                 left to implementers.

                                  • The quantification is implementation dependent, but some facts can be recalled
                                    here. First, the SCP ensures the atomicity of updates for fields and objects, and a
                                    power-failure during a transaction or the normal runtime does not create the loss of
                                    otherwise permanent data, in the sense that memory on a smart card is essentially
                                    persistent with this respect (EEPROM). Data stored on the RAM and subject to
                                    such failure is intended to have a limited lifetime anyway (runtime data on the stack,
                                    transient objects’ contents). According to this, the loss of data within the TSF scope
                                    should be limited to the same restrictions of the transaction mechanism.

7.4.1          Rationale for Exclusion of Dependencies
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER] is unsupported. This ST does not require the iden-
tification of the "installer" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[ADEL] is unsupported. This ST does not require the identification
of the "deletion manager" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] is unsupported. The dependency between FMT_MSA.1[JCRE]
and FMT_SMF.1 is not satisfied because no management functions are required for the Java Card RE.
The dependency FAU_SAA.1 of FAU_ARP.1 is unsupported. The dependency of FAU_ARP.1 on FAU_SAA.1
assumes that a "potential security violation" generates an audit event. On the contrary, the events listed in FAU_
ARP.1 are self-contained (arithmetic exception, ill-formed bytecodes, access failure) and ask for a straightforward
reaction of the TSFs on their occurrence at runtime. The JCVM or other components of the TOE detect these
events during their usual working order. Thus, there is no mandatory audit recording in this ST.
The dependency FIA_UAU.1 of FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is unsupported. The TOE implements the firewall access
control SFP, based on which access to the object Implementing FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is organized.

The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[UDW] is unsupported. The TOE does not implement any other
management functions than modification of S.FAR which is already covered by FMT_MSA.1[UDW].


7.5          Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [9]. The Security Target uses the augmen-
tations from the PP, chooses EAL6 and adds the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1. The rationale for the
augmentations is the same as in the PP.
The assurance level EAL6 is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, part 3 [5]. The assurance components
in an EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually supportive and complete set of components. The
additional requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies, which are not already fulfilled for
the corresponding requirements contained in EAL6. Therefore, the components ASE_TSS.2 and ALC_FLR.1 add
additional assurance to EAL6, but the mutual support of the requirements is still guaranteed.
All components required for EAL6 are already met by the augmentations on the underlying hardware apart from
SPM. As the SPM for this TOE is independent of the Hardware, then the requirements for EAL6 composition are
met.

SF.JCVM                        Java Card Virtual Machine

                               SF.JCVM provides the Java Card Virtual Machine including byte code interpretation and the Java
                               Card Firewall according to the specifications [34, 35]. This fulfills the SFRs FDP_IFC.1[JCVM],
                               FDP_IFF.1[JCVM], FMT_SMF.1, FMT_SMR.1, FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL], FDP_ACF.1[FIREWALL],
                               FDP_ACC.2[FIREWALL] and FIA_UID.2[AID]. SF.JCVM supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1
                               by throwing Java Exceptions according to these specifications. Additionally it supports these
                               SFRs by verification of the integrity of used Java object headers.
                               Security attributes in SF.JCVM are separated from user data and not accessible by applets

                      to fulfill FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] and FMT_MSA.1[JCVM]. All values for security attributes are ini-
                      tialized and assigned by the system itself which fulfills FMT_MSA.2[FIREWALL-JCVM], FMT_
                      MSA.3[FIREWALL], and FMT_MSA.3[JCVM].
                      SF.JCVM ensures together with SF.PERS_MEM that the system is halted in case non existing
                      Java objects could be referenced after an aborted transaction to fulfill FDP_RIP.1[ABORT].

SF.CONFIG             Configuration Management

                      SF.CONFIG provides means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data before TOE
                      delivery FAU_SAS.1[SCP].
                      SF.CONFIG provides means to change configurations of the card. Some configurations can
                      be changed by the customer and some can only be changed by NXP (FDP_IFC.2[CFG], FDP_
                      IFF.1[CFG], FMT_MSA.3[CFG], FMT_MSA.1[CFG], FMT_SMR.1[CFG], FMT_SMF.1[CFG], FIA_
                      UID.1[CFG]). SF.CONFIG supports FCS_COP.1 by configuring the behavior of cryptographic op-
                      erations.
                      Additionally, SF.CONFIG provides proprietary commands to select (FIA_UID.1[SC]) the OS up-
                      date mechanism SF.OSU and to reset the OS to an initial state (FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1).

SF.OPEN               Card Content Management

                      SF.OPEN provides the card content management functionality according the GlobalPlatform
                      Specification [22] and GlobalPlatform Amendments A [20], D [30], E [31] and F [32]. This sup-
                      ports FCO_NRO.2[SC], FDP_ACC.1[SD], FDP_ACF.1[SD], FDP_UIT.1[CCM], FDP_IFF.1[SC],
                      FDP_IFC.2[SC], FIA_UID.1[SC], FIA_UID.2[AID], FIA_USB.1[AID], FMT_MSA.1[SC], FMT_MSA.1[SD],
                      FMT_MSA.3[SC], FMT_MSA.3[SD], FMT_SMF.1[ADEL], FMT_SMR.1[SD], FMT_SMF.1[SC], FMT_
                      SMF.1[SD], FTP_ITC.1[SC], FMT_MSA.3[ADEL], FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER], FMT_SMR.1[ADEL],
                      FDP_ITC.2[CCM], FDP_ROL.1[CCM], FIA_UAU.1[SC], FIA_UAU.4[SC], FTP_ITC.1[SC] and FCS_
                      COP.1 (for DAP verification). In addition to the GP specification, the Java Card Runtime Envi-
                      ronment specification [34] is followed to support FDP_ACC.2[ADEL], FDP_ACF.1[ADEL], FMT_
                      MSA.3[SC], FMT_MSA.3[SD], FMT_MTD.1[JCRE], FMT_MTD.3[JCRE], FPT_FLS.1[INSTALLER],
                      FDP_RIP.1[bArray], FDP_RIP.1[ADEL], FPT_TDC.1, FPT_FLS.1[ADEL], and FPT_FLS.1[CCM]
                      for application loading, installation, and deletion.
                      AID management is provided by SF.OPEN according to the GlobalPlatform Specification [22],
                      the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [34], and the Java Card API Specification [33]
                      to support FIA_ATD.1[AID].
                      SF.OPEN is part of the TOE runtime environment and thus separated from other applications
                      to fulfill FMT_MSA.1[ADEL]. It supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1 by responding with error
                      messages and fulfills FPT_RCV.3[INSTALLER] by inherent memory cleanup in case of aborted
                      loading and installation.

                      SF.CRYPTO provides key creation, key management, key deletion and cryptographic function-
                      ality. It provides the API in accordance to the Java Card API Specification [33] to fulfill FCS_
                      CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3, FCS_CKM.4, and FCS_COP.1. Proprietary solutions (e.g.,
                      key lengths not supported by the Java Card API) are supported following the Java Card API.
                      SF.CRYPTO uses SF.DATA_STORAGE to support FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3,
                      FCS_CKM.4, FDP_RIP.1[KEYS], and FDP_SDI.2. The Security Software certified with the TOE
                      hardware supports FCS_COP.1 and FPR_UNO.1.

                      numbers according to FCS_RNG.1.

SF.DATA_STORAGE       Secure Data Storage

                      SF.DATA_STORAGE provides a secure data storage for confidential data. It is used to store
                      cryptographic keys (supports FCS_CKM.1, FCS_CKM.2, FCS_CKM.3, and FCS_CKM.4) and to
                      store PINs (supports FIA_AFL.1[PIN]). All data stored by SF.DATA_STORAGE is CRC32 integrity
                      protected to fulfill FDP_SDI.2, FAU_ARP.1, and FPT_FLS.1. The stored data is AES encrypted
                      to fulfill FPR_UNO.1.

                      SF.OSU provides secure functionality to update the JCOP4 OS or UpdaterOS itself with an im-
                      age created by a trusted off-card entity (FMT_SMR.1[OSU], FMT_SMF.1[OSU]). SF.OSU allows
                      an authenticated OSU command (FIA_UAU.4[OSU]) to upload an integrity and confidentiality
                      protected update image to update to another operating system version(FDP_IFC.2[OSU], FDP_
                      IFF.1[OSU]).
                      User authentication is based on the verification of signed OSU commands to fulfill FIA_UAU.1[OSU]
                      and FIA_UID.1[OSU]. Integrity protection of OSU commands uses ECDSA, SHA-256 and CRC
                      verification to fulfill FDP_IFF.1[OSU]. Confidentiality of the update image is ensured by ECDH
                      and AES encryption to fulfill FDP_IFF.1[OSU]. SF.OSU ensures that the system stays in a secure
                      state in case of invalid or aborted update procedures to fulfill FPT_FLS.1[OSU] and ensures that
                      the information identifying the currently running OS is modified and the updated code is activated
                      only after successfull OS Update procedure FMT_MSA.3[OSU], FMT_MSA.1[OSU].

                      is controlled by FDP_ACC.2[UDW], FDP_ACF.1[UDW], FMT_MSA.3[UDW]FMT_MSA.1[UDW]
                      and FMT_SMR.1[SD]. SF.UDW ensures that the Factory Reset process gets finished even in
                      case it gets interrupted (e.g. by a tearing event.) which is supported by FPT_FLS.1[UDW].

SF.OM                 Java Object Management

                      SF.OM provides the object management for Java objects which are processed by SF.JCVM. It
                      provides object creation (FDP_RIP.1[OBJECTS]) and garbage collection according to the Java
                      Card Runtime Environment Specification [34] to fulfill FDP_RIP.1[ODEL] and FPT_FLS.1[ODEL].
                      SF.OM throws an Java Exception in case an object cannot be created as requested due to too
                      less available memory. This fulfills FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

SF.MM                 Memory Management

                      SF.MM provides deletion of memory for transient arrays, global arrays, and logical channels
                      according to the Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [34]. Thus, it fulfills FDP_
                      RIP.1[TRANSIENT] by granting access to and erasing of CLEAR_ON_RESET and CLEAR_ON_
                      DESELECT transient arrays. It supports FIA_ATD.1[AID] when using logical channels and it ful-
                      fills FDP_RIP.1[APDU] and FDP_RIP.1[bArray] by clearing the APDU buffers for new incoming
                      data and by clearing the bArray during application installation.

SF.PIN                PIN Management

                      SF.PIN provides secure PIN management by using SF.DATA_STORAGE for PIN objects speci-
                      fied in the Java Card API Specification [33] and the GlobalPlatform Specification [24]. Thus, it
                      fulfills FDP_SDI.2, FIA_AFL.1[PIN], and FPR_UNO.1.

SF.PERS_MEM           Persistent Memory Management

                      SF.PERS_MEM provides atomic write operations and transaction management according to the
                      Java Card Runtime Environment Specification [34]. This supports FAU_ARP.1, FPT_FLS.1, and
                      FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL].
                      SF.PERS_MEM supports FDP_RIP.1[ABORT] together with SF.JCVM by halting the system in
                      case of object creation in aborted transactions.
                      Low level write routines to persistent memory in SF.PERS_MEM perform checks for defect mem-
                      ory cells to fulfill FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

SF.EDC                Error Detection Code API

                      SF.EDC provides an Java API for user applications to perform high performing integrity checks
                      based on a checksum on Java arrays [10]. The API throws a Java Exception in case the check-
                      sum in invalid. This supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

SF.HW_EXC              Hardware Exception Handling

                       SF.HW_EXC provides software exception handler to react on unforeseen events captured by the
                       hardware (hardware exceptions). SF.HW_EXC catches the hardware exceptions and ensures
                       the system goes to a secure state to fulfill FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1.

SF.RM                  Restricted Mode

                       SF.RM provides a restricted mode that is entered when the Attack Counter reaches its limit. In
                       restricted mode only limited functionality is available. Only the issuer is able to reset the Attack
                       Counter to leave the restricted mode. This supports FDP_ACC.2[RM], FDP_ACF.1[RM], FMT_
                       MSA.3[RM], FMT_MSA.1[RM], and FMT_SMF.1[RM]. SF.RM only allows a limited set of opera-
                       tions to not identified and not authenticated users when in restricted mode. All other operations
                       require identification and authentication(FIA_UID.1[RM], FIA_UAU.1[RM]).

SF.PID                 Platform Identification

                       SF.PID provides a platform identifier. For elements that can be identified see 1.9. This feature
                       supports FAU_SAS.1.1[SCP] by using initialization data that is used for platform identification.

SF.ACC_SBX             Secure Box

                       SF.ACC_SBX provides an environment to securely execute native code from third parties. SF.ACC_
                       SBX ensures that only program code and data contained in the secure box can be accessed
                       from within this secure box and therefore cannot harm, manipulate, or influence other parts
                       of the TOE. This fulfills the SFRs FDP_ACC.2[SecureBox], FDP_ACF.1[SecureBox] and FMT_
                       MSA.1[SecureBox].
                       Native code executed in the Secure Box is executed in Application Unprivileged Mode. Access to
                       the CPU mode, memory outside the Secure Box, the MMU segment table, and Special Function
                       Registers which allow configuration of the MMU and allow System Management is prohibited for
                       code executed in the Secure Box to fulfill FDP_ACF.1[SecureBox].
                       The MMU segment table to configure the MMU is part of the Secure Box which fulfils FMT_
                       MSA.3[SecureBox]. This MMU segment table can be modified during the prepersonalization
                       in accordance with FMT_MSA.3[SecureBox] to specify alternative settings for initially restrictive
                       values for the MMU segment table. This supports FMT_SMF.1[SecureBox].


8.3          Protection against Interference and Logical Tampering
The protection of JCOP4 against Interference and Logical Tampering is implemented in software within the TOE
and supported by the hardware of the micro controller.
The software protection of the TOE makes use of software security services which allow to detect and react on
manipulation of the TOE. Two types of reactions are used: If invalid data from outside the TOE is detected then it

is assumed that the TOE was used in a wrong way. This is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception.
Detected deviations from the physical operating conditions and inconsistencies of internal states and program
flow however are considered to be an attack to the TOE. In such cases an internal Attack Counter is increased.
Once the Attack Counter reaches the maximum value, the TOE will go into Restricted Mode.
Typical software security mechanisms implemented in the TOE are e.g.:

     • Complex patterned values are used instead of boolean values which are sensible to tampering (only one bit
         needs to be changed to manipulate a false into a true).

     • Small random delays are inserted in the program flow to make successful physical interfering more difficult.

     • Secret information like Keys or PINs are stored encrypted in the TOE. The Masterkey to decrypt these is not
         accessible during normal operation.

     • Critical data is read after it has been written to non volatile memory.

     • Enhanced cryptographic support is based on the certified Security Software for DES, AES, ECC and RSA
         including protection against fault injection and random number generation.

     • Critical values (like PINs) are compared timing-invariant. This prevents from side channel attacks.

A full list of software countermeasures is contained in ADV_ARC.
Further protection against Tampering and Logical Interference is realized by the MMU implemented in hardware.
The MMU is able to perform access control to all types of memory. The special function registers access can be
restricted by the bridges between the CPU and the peripherals.
JCOP4 defines several MMU contexts which restrict access to memory areas. The Master key is stored in specific
coprocessor registers and blocked for reading/writing during JCOP operation.
Additionally Interference and Logical Tampering is prevented by hardware security services. JCOP4 OS runs on
a certified smart card HW platform which protects against bypass by physical and logical means such as:

     • cryptographic coprocessors (for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography) protected against DPA and DFA,

     • enhanced security sensors for clock frequency range, low and high temperature sensor, supply voltage
         sensors Single Fault Injection (SFI) attack detection, light sensors, and

     • encryption of data stored in persistent and transient memory.


8.4          Protection against Bypass of Security Related Actions
JCOP4 prevents bypassing security related actions by several software counter measures. Different mechanisms
are used depending on the software environment.

Generally all input parameter are validated and in case of incorrect parameters the program flow is interrupted.
Such event is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception. This prevents the TOE from being attacked
by undefined or unauthorized commands or data.
Basic protection is contributed by implementation of following standards within the TOE:

     • Java Applets are separated from each other as defined in the Java Card specifications [33, 34, 35]. The
         separation is achieved by implementation of the firewall which prevents Applets to access data belonging to
         a different Java Card context. Sharing information between different contexts is possible by supervision of
         the well defined Java Card Firewall mechanism implemented in the TOE.

     • Access to security relevant Applications in the TOE (like Security Domains) is protected by the Secure
         Channel mechanism defined by Global platform [24]. The secure channel allows access to Applications
         only if the secret keys are known. Further protection implemented in JCOP4 prevents brute force attacks to
         the secret keys of the Secure Channel.

The following mechanisms ensure that it is not possible to access information from the Java Layer without being
authorized to do so.

     • Status informations like Life Cycle of Applets or the Authentication State of a Secure Channel are stored in
         complex patterned values which protects them from manipulation.

     • Correct order of Java Card Byte Code execution is ensured by the Virtual Machine which detects if Byte
         Code of a wrong context is executed.

     • Correct processing of Byte Codes is ensured by checking at the beginning and end of Byte Code execution
         that the same Byte Code is executed.

Execution of native code in JCOP4 is protected by following mechanisms:

     • Critical execution paths of the TOE functionality are protected by program flow and call tree protection. This
         ensures that it is not possible to bypass security relevant checks and verifications.

     • Critical conditions are evaluated twice. This ensures that physical attacks on the compared values are
         detected during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • The true case in if-conditions leads to the less critical program flow or to an error case. This prevents attacks
         on the program flow during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • At the exit of critical loops it is checked that the whole loop was processed. This prevents from manipulation
         of the program flow and jumping out of the loop.

     • Critical parameters are check for consistency. This prevents from attacks with manipulated parameters.

Further protection is achieved by using different buffers for APDUs in case more than one physical interface is
supported. This prevents bypassing the state machine on one physical interface by the other interface.

10            Glossary
Additional Code Code activated by the Atomic Activation on the Initial TOE to generate the final TOE. For in-
         stance, Additional Code could: correct flaws, add new functionalities, update the operating system. Also
         referred to as D.UPDATE_IMAGE.

APDU buffer The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent (received) by the card depart from (ar-
         rive to). The JCRE owns an APDU object (which is a JCRE Entry Point and an instance of the javac-
         ard.framework.APDU class) that encapsulates APDU messages in an internal byte array, called the APDU
         buffer. This object is made accessible to the currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent
         access (out-of selection-scope) is strictly prohibited for security reasons.

applet deletion manager The on-card component that embodies the mechanisms necessary to delete an applet
         or library and its associated data on smart cards using Java Card technology.

Atomic Activation The Loader guarantees at activation time that the loaded Additional Code is activated and
         that the Identification Data of the TOE is updated. This functionality is called Atomic Activation. If the Atomic
         Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise (in case of interruption or
         incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail
         secure.

context A context is an object-space partition associated to a package. Applets within the same Java technology-
         based package belong to the same context. The firewall is the boundary between contexts (see "current
         context").

current context The JCRE keeps track of the current Java Card System context (also called "the active context").
         When a virtual method is invoked on an object, and a context switch is required and permitted, the current
         context is changed to correspond to the context of the applet that owns the object. When that method
         returns, the previous context is restored. Invocations of static methods have no effect on the current context.
         The current context and sharing status of an object together determine if access to an object is permissible.

currently selected applet The applet has been selected for execution in the current session. The Java Card RE
         keeps track of the currently selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command from the CAD
         or PCD with this applet’s AID, the Java Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over the I/O
         interface that received the command. The Java Card RE sends all further APDU commands received over
         each interface to the currently selected applet on this interface ([34], Glossary).

default applet The applet that is selected after a card reset ([34], §4.1).

Final TOE The Final TOE is generated from the Initial TOE and the Additional Code. It is the resulting product of
         the Atomic Activation of the Additional Code onto the Initial TOE..

Initial TOE The Initial TOE is the product on which the Additional Code is loaded and with the Loader as part of
         the embedded software.

installer The installer is the on-card application responsible for the installation of applets on the card. It may per-
         form (or delegate) mandatory security checks according to the card issuer policy (for bytecode-verification,
         for instance), loads and link packages (CAP file(s)) on the card to a suitable form for the Java Card VM to
         execute the code they contain. It is a subsystem of what is usually called “card manager”; as such, it can be
         seen as the portion of the card manager that belongs to the TOE.
         The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may be implemented as a Java Card applet.
         However, it is granted specific privileges on an implementation-specific manner ([34], §10).

interface A special kind of Java programming language class, which declares methods, but provides no imple-
         mentation for them. A class may be declared as being the implementation of an interface, and in this case
         must contain an implementation for each of the methods declared by the interface (See also shareable
         interface).

Java Card RE The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart card are executed. It is in charge
         of all the management features such as applet lifetime, applet isolation, object sharing, applet loading, applet
         initializing, transient objects, the transaction mechanism and so on.

Java Card RE Entry Point An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible by any application.
         These methods are the gateways through which applets request privileged Java Card RE services: the
         instance methods associated to those objects may be invoked from any context, and when that occurs, a
         context switch to the Java Card RE context is performed.
         There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects: Temporary ones and Permanent ones. As
         part of the firewall functionality, the Java Card RE detects and restricts attempts to store references to these
         objects.

Java Card RMI Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition
         mechanism enabling a client application running on the CAD platform to invoke a method on a remote object

         on the card. Notice that in Java Card System, version 2.1.1, the only method that may be invoked from the
         CAD is the process method of the applet class and that in Java Card System, version 3 Classic Edition, this
         functionality is optional.

Java Card System Java Card System includes the Java Card RE, the Java Card VM, the Java Card API and the
         installer.

Java Card VM The embedded interpreter of bytecodes. The Java Card VM is the component that enforces
         separation between applications (firewall) and enables secure data sharing.

Load Phase The Load Phase is starting at the beginning of the Additional Code loading and ending at the end
         of Atomic Activation. During the Load Phase, the Initial TOE shall be in a secure state..

Loader The Loader is the software developed by the Product Manufacturer. It is used to load and activate the
         Additional Code into the Product FLASH or EEPROM memory. The Loader is included in the embedded
         software and is considered as part of the Initial TOE. see also UpdaterOS.

logical channel A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the Java Card System, version
         2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that enables the opening of simultaneous sessions with the card, one per logical
         channel. Commands issued to a specific logical channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical
         channel. Java Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical
         channels over each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).

MC FW Microcontroller Firmware. Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller.

NVRAM Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that retains its contents when power is turned
         off.

object deletion The Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism ensures that any unrefer-
         enced persistent (transient) object owned by the current context is deleted. The associated memory space
         is recovered for reuse prior to the next card reset.

package A package is a namespace within the Java programming language that may contain classes and inter-
         faces. A package defines either a user library, or one or more applet definitions. A package is divided in two
         sets of files: export files (which exclusively contain the public interface information for an entire package of
         classes, for external linking purposes; export files are not used directly in a Java Card virtual machine) and
         CAP files.

Secure Box The Secure Box is a construct which allows to run non certified third party native code and ensures
         that this code cannot harm, influence or manipulate the JCOP operating system or any of the applets
         executed by the operating system.

Secure Box Native Library The Secure Box Native Library is non certified third party native code running in the
         Secure Box.

shareable interface An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet accepts to share with other
         applets. These interface methods can be invoked from an applet in a context different from the context of
         the object implementing the methods, thus “traversing” the firewall.

subject An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow among objects or change the system’s
         status. It usually acts on the behalf of a user. Objects can be active and thus are also subjects of the TOE.

transient object An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD sessions. The contents of these
         objects are cleared at the end of the current CAD session or when a card reset is performed. Writes to the
         fields of a transient object are not affected by transactions.

UpdaterOS OS that implements the OS Update.

user Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE. That also covers the packages. The associated sub-
         ject(s), if applicable, is (are) an object(s) belonging to the javacard.framework.applet class.

11            Acronyms
AID Application Identifier, an ISO-7816 data format used for unique identification of Java Card applications (and
         certain kinds of files in card file systems). The Java Card platform uses the AID data format to identify
         applets and packages. AIDs are administered by the International Standards Organization (ISO), so they
         can be used as unique identifiers.
         AIDs are also used in the security policies (see ’Context’ below): applets’ AIDs are related to the selection
         mechanisms, packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the firewall. Note: although they serve different
         purposes, they share the same name space.

AP Application Provider.

applet The name is given to a Java Card technology-based user application. An applet is the basic piece of code
         that can be selected for execution from outside the card. Each applet on the card is uniquely identified by
         its AID.

APSD Application Provider Security Domain.

ARM Advanced RISC Machine.

CAD Card Acceptance Device, or card reader. The device where the card is inserted, and which is used to
         communicate with the card.

DFA Differential Fault Analysis, a side channel attack that induces faults into cryptographic implementations, to
         reveal their internal states..

DPA Differential Power Analysis is a form of side channel attack in which an attacker studies the power consump-
         tion of a cryptographic hardware device such as a smart card.
