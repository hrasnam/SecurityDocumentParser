Foreword
The Netherlands Scheme for Certification in the Area of IT Security (NSCIB) provides a third-party
evaluation and certification service for determining the trustworthiness of Information Technology (IT)
security products. Under this NSCIB, TÜV Rheinland Nederland B.V. has the task of issuing
certificates for IT security products, as well as for protection profiles and sites.
Part of the procedure is the technical examination (evaluation) of the product, protection profile or site
according to the Common Criteria assessment guidelines published by the NSCIB. Evaluations are
performed by an IT Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF) under the oversight of the NSCIB Certification
Body, which is operated by TÜV Rheinland Nederland B.V. in cooperation with the Ministry of the
Interior and Kingdom Relations.
An ITSEF in the Netherlands is a commercial facility that has been licensed by TÜV Rheinland
Nederland B.V. to perform Common Criteria evaluations; a significant requirement for such a license is
accreditation to the requirements of ISO Standard 17025 “General requirements for the accreditation
of calibration and testing laboratories”.
By awarding a Common Criteria certificate, TÜV Rheinland Nederland B.V. asserts that the product or
site complies with the security requirements specified in the associated (site) security target, or that
the protection profile (PP) complies with the requirements for PP evaluation specified in the Common
Criteria for Information Security Evaluation. A (site) security target is a requirements specification
document that defines the scope of the evaluation activities.
The consumer should review the (site) security target or protection profile, in addition to this
certification report, in order to gain an understanding of any assumptions made during the evaluation,
the IT product's intended environment, its security requirements, and the level of confidence (i.e., the
evaluation assurance level) that the product or site satisfies the security requirements stated in the
(site) security target.

Recognition of the certificate
Presence of the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement and SOG-IS logos on the certificate
indicates that this certificate is issued in accordance with the provisions of the CCRA and the SOG-IS
agreement and will be recognised by the participating nations.

International recognition
The CCRA has been signed by the Netherlands in May 2000 and provides mutual recognition of
certificates based on the CC. Starting September 2014 the CCRA has been updated to provide mutual
recognition of certificates based on cPPs (exact use) or STs with evaluation assurance components
up to and including EAL2+ALC_FLR. The current list of signatory nations and approved certification
schemes can be found on: http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org.

European recognition

® TÜV, TUEV and TUV are registered trademarks. Any use or application requires prior approval.

The European SOGIS-Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOGIS-MRA) version 3 effective from April
2010 provides mutual recognition of Common Criteria and ITSEC certificates at a basic evaluation
level for all products. A higher recognition level for evaluation levels beyond EAL4 (resp. E3-basic) is
provided for products related to specific technical domains. This agreement was initially signed by
Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Italy
joined the SOGIS-MRA in December 2010. The current list of signatory nations, approved certification
schemes and the list of technical domains for which the higher recognition applies can be found on:
http://www.sogisportal.eu.

1 Executive Summary
This Certification Report states the outcome of the Common Criteria security evaluation of the IDeal
Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration). The developer
of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration) is
IDEMIA located in Osny, France and they also act as the sponsor of the evaluation and certification. A
Certification Report is intended to assist prospective consumers when judging the suitability of the IT
security properties of the product for their particular requirements.
The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a contact and contactless chip of a machine readable travel
document (MRTD) based on the requirements and recommendations of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), EU requirements for biometric European passport and Biometric European
Resident Permit. This product is intended to enable verification of the authenticity of the travel
document and to identify its holder during a border control, using an inspection system. The
verification process is based on Extended Access Control with Password Authenticated Connection
Establishment (PACE), Chip Authentication v1, Terminal Authentication v1 and optionally Active
Authentication (AA).
The TOE may also be used as an ISO driving license, compliant to ISO/IEC 18013 or ISO/IEC TR
19446 supporting AA, as both applications (MRTD and IDL) share the same protocols and data
structure organization.
The TOE also supports the Polymorphic eMRTD according to Polymorphic eMRTD Specification by
the Dutch National Office for Identity Data (written by IDEMIA), allowing Polymorphic Authentication
with Randomization of the Polymorphic Pseudonym, Polymorphic Identity and Polymorphic
Complementary ID attributes.
The TOE has been originally evaluated by Brightsight B.V. located in Delft, The Netherlands and was
certified on 2018-06-26. The re-evaluation also took place by Brightsight B.V. and was completed on
2019-02-18 with the approval of the ETR. The re-certification procedure has been conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Netherlands Scheme for Certification in the Area of IT Security
[NSCIB].
This second issue of the Certification Report is a result of a “recertification with major changes”.

® TÜV, TUEV and TUV are registered trademarks. Any use or application requires prior approval.

The major changes are an addition of an extra patch level (PL4) for the underlying platform, and the
addition of delivery of the TOE with the applet in ROM.
The security evaluation re-used the evaluation results of previously performed evaluations. A full, up to
date vulnerability analysis has been made, reusing existing penetration testing and renewed functional
testing.
The scope of the evaluation is defined by the security target [ST], which identifies assumptions made
during the evaluation, the intended environment for the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection
(SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration), the security requirements, and the level of confidence
(evaluation assurance level) at which the product is intended to satisfy the security requirements.
Consumers of the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD
Configuration) are advised to verify that their own environment is consistent with the security target,
and to give due consideration to the comments, observations and recommendations in this
certification report.
1

The results documented in the evaluation technical report [ETR] for this product provide sufficient
evidence that the TOE meets the EAL5 augmented (EAL5+) assurance requirements for the evaluated
security functionality. This assurance level is augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and AVA_VAN.5.
The evaluation was conducted using the Common Methodology for Information Technology Security
Evaluation, Version 3.1 Revision 5 [CEM], for conformance to the Common Criteria for Information
Technology Security Evaluation, version 3.1 Revision 5 [CC].
TÜV Rheinland Nederland B.V., as the NSCIB Certification Body, declares that the evaluation meets
all the conditions for international recognition of Common Criteria Certificates and that the product will

To ensure secure usage a set of guidance documents is provided together with the IDeal Pass v2.3-n
JC with Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration). Details can be found in
section 2.5 of this report. (Note that the guidance is only delivered via the Haarlem site.)
For a detailed and precise description of the TOE lifecycle refer to the [ST], section 1.4.3.

2.2

Security Policy

The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is a contactless or contact based integrated circuit chip of machine
readable travel documents (MRTD) and provides the Extended Access Control according to ‘ICAO
Doc 9303’ as well as optional Active Authentication according to ‘ICAO Doc 9303’ if enabled during
the personalization.
The communication between terminal and chip shall be protected by Password Authenticated
Connection Establishment (PACE), optionally with Chip Authentication Mapping (PACE CAM)
according to Electronic Passport Standards using the Standard Inspection Procedure with PACE
(PACE PP), BSI-CC-PP-0068-V2 [PACE-PP]. Polymorphic eMRTD extensions are present on the
TOE that enable secure authentication with enhanced privacy protection features. It provides the
holder the possibility to authenticate towards a service provider in a non-traceable and non-linkable
manner thanks to usage of Polymorphic Pseudonyms and other Polymorphic ID attributes.

2.3.1

Assumptions and Clarification of Scope
Assumptions

The assumptions defined in the Security Target are not covered by the TOE itself. These aspects lead
to specific Security Objectives to be fulfilled by the TOE-Environment. Detailed information on these

Page: 9/14 of report number: NSCIB-CC-180351-CR2, dated 18 February 2019

security objectives that must be fulfilled by the TOE environment can be found in section 4.2 of the
[ST].

2.3.2

Clarification of scope

The evaluation did not reveal any threats to the TOE that are not countered by the evaluated security
functions of the product.
Note that the ICAO MRTD infrastructure critically depends on the objectives for the environment to be
met. These are not weaknesses of this particular TOE, but aspects of the ICAO MRTD infrastructure
as a whole.
The environment in which the TOE is personalized must perform proper and safe personalization
according to the guidance and referred ICAO guidelines.
The environment in which the TOE is used must ensure that the inspection system protects the
confidentiality and integrity of the data send and read from the TOE.

2.4

2.6

IT Product Testing

Testing (depth, coverage, functional tests, independent testing): The evaluators examined the
developer’s testing activities documentation and verified that the developer has met their testing
responsibilities.

2.6.1

Testing approach and depth

The developer has performed extensive testing on functional specification, subsystem and module
level. All parameter choices have been addressed at least once. All boundary cases identified have
been tested explicitly, and additionally the near-boundary conditions have been covered. The testing
was largely automated using industry standard and proprietary test suites. Test scripts were
extensively used to verify that the commands return the expected values.
The underlying hardware, crypto-library and Javacard test results are extendable to composite
evaluations, as the underlying platform is operated according to its guidance and the composite
evaluation requirements are met.
For the testing performed by the evaluators, the developer has provided samples and a test
environment. The evaluators have reproduced a selection of the developer tests, as well as a small
number of test cases designed by the evaluator.

2.6.2

Independent Penetration Testing

The penetration tests are devised after performing the Evaluator Vulnerability Analysis. The reference
for attack techniques to which smart card-based devices such as the TOE must be protected against
is the document named "Attack methods for smart cards" and referenced as [JIL-AP]. The
susceptibility of the TOE to these attacks has been analysed in a white box investigation.

® TÜV, TUEV and TUV are registered trademarks. Any use or application requires prior approval.

The methodical analysis performed was conducted along the following steps:
1. When evaluating the evidence in the classes ASE, ADV and AGD potential vulnerabilities were
identified from generating questions to the type of TOE and the specified behaviour.
2. A couple of detailed code reviews were performed on increasing versions of the implementation
representation of the TOE, identified potential vulnerabilities were addressed.
3. An attack oriented analysis was performed according to the attack list in [JIL-AP]. For each of
the attacks assurance for protection against the attacks was analysed using the knowledge
gained from all evaluation classes. An important source for assurance against attacks in this
step is the [JC-ETRfC] of the underlying platform. No additional potential vulnerabilities were
concluded from this step.
4. All potential vulnerabilities were analysed for their protection using the total of the knowledge
gained from all evaluation classes and the review on the implementation representation. It was
concluded that for each of the potential vulnerabilities the TOE is protected such that the attack
is not practical.
5. In a next step choices were made for penetration testing. Because no suspicion remained for
potential vulnerabilities a choice for penetration testing was made to verify resistance against
perturbation attacks for PMA functionality.
Two perturbation attacks were tested, with light and EMFI perturbation, for two weeks, re-used from
the previous evaluation.

2.6.3

Test Configuration

The TOE has been tested in pre-personalisation, personalisation and operational life-cycle states with
applet instance configurations specified in the Security Target [ST] section 1.4.2.

2.6.4

Testing Results

The testing activities, including configurations, procedures, test cases, expected results and observed
results are summarised in the [ETR], with references to the documents containing the full details.
The developer’s tests and the independent functional tests produced the expected results, giving
assurance that the TOE behaves as specified in its [ST] and functional specification.
No exploitable vulnerabilities were found with the independent penetration tests.

Page: 11/14 of report number: NSCIB-CC-180351-CR2, dated 18 February 2019

The algorithmic security level of cryptographic functionality has not been rated in this certification
process, but the current consensus on the algorithmic security level in the open domain, i.e. from the
current best cryptanalytic attacks published, has been taken into account.
The algorithmic security level exceeds 100 bits for all evaluated cryptographic functionality as required
for high attack potential (AVA_VAN.5).
The strength of the implementation of the cryptographic functionality has been assessed in the
evaluation, as part of the AVA_VAN activities. No exploitable vulnerabilities were found with the
independent penetration tests.

2.7

Re-used evaluation results

In December 2018 and January 2019 a re-evaluation has been conducted for minor changes made to
the TOE. In this re-evaluation the vulnerability analysis and evaluator independent testing have been
renewed. It was concluded that all conclusions for the base evaluation are still applicable to the new
changed TOE.
There has been extensive re-use of the ALC aspects for the sites involved in the development and
production of the TOE, by use of 5 site re-use report approaches for:
•IDEMIA site in Osny R&D (development)
•IDEMIA site in Meyreuil R&D (development)
•IDEMIA site in Noida R&D (development)
•IDEMIA site in Haarlem (development and production)
•IDEMIA site in Noida plant (production)
No sites have been visited as part of this evaluation.

2.8

Evaluated Configuration

The TOE is defined uniquely by its name and version number IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with Privacy
Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration). The guidance documents describe how to
verify the TOE and configure it.

2.9

Results of the Evaluation
2

The evaluation lab documented their evaluation results in the [ETR] which references an ASE
Intermediate Report and other evaluator documents.
The verdict of each claimed assurance requirement is “Pass”.
Based on the above evaluation results the evaluation lab concluded the IDeal Pass v2.3-n JC with
Privacy Protection (SAC/EAC/Polymorphic eMRTD Configuration), to be CC Part 2 extended, CC
Part 3 conformant, and to meet the requirements of EAL 5 augmented with ALC_DVS.2 and
AVA_VAN.5. This implies that the product satisfies the security requirements specified in Security
Target [ST].
The Security Target claims ’strict’ conformance to the Protection Profile [PACE-PP] and [EACPP-V2].

2.10 Comments/Recommendations
The user guidance as outlined in section 2.5 contains necessary information about the usage of the
TOE. Certain aspects of the TOE’s security functionality, in particular the countermeasures against
attacks, depend on accurate conformance to the user guidance. There are no particular obligations or
recommendations for the user apart from following the user guidance.
In addition all aspects of assumptions, threats and policies as outlined in the Security Target not
covered by the TOE itself need to be fulfilled by the operational environment of the TOE.

The customer or user of the product shall consider the results of the certification within his system risk
management process. In order for the evolution of attack methods and techniques to be covered, he
should define the period of time until a re-assessment for the TOE is required and thus requested from
the sponsor of the certificate.
The strength of the cryptographic algorithms and protocols was not rated in the course of this
evaluation. This specifically applies to any proprietary or non-standard algorithms or protocols that use
the Polymorphic Authentication functionality.
To fend off attackers with high attack potential appropriate cryptographic algorithms with adequate key
lengths must be used (references can be found in national and international documents and
standards).
Note that the same TOE in BAC and optional AA Configuration has been re-certified under ID NSCIBCC-180045.
